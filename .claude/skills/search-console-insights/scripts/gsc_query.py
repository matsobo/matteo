gsc_query.py — Phase 1 of the search-console-insights skill.

Pulls Google Search Console *Search Analytics* data (queries, pages, CTR,
average position) via the official API and writes a Markdown report that
surfaces the highest-leverage things:

  1. Where each TARGET keyword currently ranks (or "not yet ranking").
  2. Striking-distance queries (avg position ~8-20) — the fastest Top-10 wins.
  3. High-impression / low-CTR pages — snippet/SERP investigation targets
     (a title/meta rewrite only after the live-SERP check confirms a
     controllable snippet problem).
  4. On demand, query<->page attribution: --page <url> (which queries land on a
     page) and --query "<q>" (which pages serve a query) — so attribution and
     cannibalization are read from data, never guessed from separate tables.

Read-only: it uses the `webmasters.readonly` scope and never writes to GSC.

Auth: OAuth "installed app" (desktop) flow. You download an OAuth client
once from Google Cloud Console (Desktop app type) as `client_secret.json`;
the first run opens a browser for consent and caches a refresh token at
~/.config/gsc-insights/token.json so later runs are non-interactive.

Usage:
  python gsc_query.py \
      --site sc-domain:example.com \
      --days 90 \
      --keywords "AI Events Munich,AI Meetups Munich,AI Treffen München" \
      --out report.md
