# New website — orchestrator

The entry point for every new site you build. It **decides the stack**,
**sequences the work**, and **scaffolds a self-contained, handoff-ready repo** from
this skill's `templates/`. Concrete content/SEO/design/QA work is delegated to seven
sibling skills + existing global skills.

Everything needed is bundled here:
- `templates/astro/` — the Astro starter overlay (Base.astro SEO+theme spine,
  `config.ts`, theme tokens, `astro.config`, `tests/` suite, CI, preview-noindex
  function, headers, llms.txt, GDPR privacy page draft). Its `README.md` is the
  assembly manual.
- `templates/SETUP.md` — accounts (GitHub + Cloudflare) + tools + the bootstrap.
- `templates/PUBLISHING.md` — plain-English "how to publish" for the owner
  (`commit`/`push`/`branch` explained + step-by-step per publish model), plus the
  assistant-facing **deploy-time guardrails** (§4).
- `templates/AGENTS.md` + `templates/CLAUDE.md` — the working rules every assistant
  (Codex, Claude Code) follows in the repo: fetch the latest state first, pull request
  instead of a direct push, when a merge is allowed, never invent facts, the new-page
  checklist. `CLAUDE.md` is one line (`@AGENTS.md`), so both tools read the same rules.
- `templates/.gitignore`, `templates/claude/settings.json` — git ignore + the
  permission allowlist to copy into the repo.
- `templates/positioning.md`, `templates/content-guide.md`, `templates/brand.md` — the per-site docs.
- `references/WEBSITE_ARCHITECTURE.md` (bundled with this skill) — the Cloudflare
  **tier 1/2/3** decision tree + limits (the tiers are also summarized in §1, question 2).

Sibling skills (run in order, each usable on its own):
`website-positioning` · `website-content-guide` · `website-seo-geo` ·
`website-design-system` · `website-testimonials` · `website-qa` ·
`website-review`. `website-positioning-check` is an optional, read-only one-screen
diagnostic for a site that already has pages — run it after the build, or whenever the
offer starts to feel blurred; it is not a pipeline gate. Plus `outgoing-link-audit` — the
pre-launch / monthly external-link
liveness sweep (only relevant once the site links out); `internal-link-audit` — the
internal-linking sweep that finds orphaned + thin pages and suggests where to cross-link
(run after adding a batch of pages); `website-permissions` — install + safely extend the
repo's permission allowlist (fewer prompts, same guardrails); `search-console-setup`
— post-launch GSC + Bing registration + IndexNow; and `website-motion` — an OPTIONAL
polish layer (stat count-up + section-heading reveal) for sites with a long scrolling
homepage, plus the reduced-motion contract and the a11y-gate change that keep motion
from silently hiding content. `website-motion` is never run by default: ask for it.
`website-story` is an OPTIONAL story layer (the home page told as the customer's story:
`STORY.md` + a seven-section home page map); it is offered once at §2a, right after
positioning, and never runs unasked.
`website-team-setup` is the other on-demand skill — run it once when a **second person**
joins the repo (invite collaborators, repo settings, prove CI triggers, block direct
pushes to `main`, connect Cloudflare Pages without the known traps, set the rights level
in `AGENTS.md`); a single owner never needs it.

## 1. Decision interview (answer before any code)

**Conduct the interview — and ALL user-facing guidance throughout this pipeline
(explanations, the §3a link-sweep question, the §4 preview-vs-live announcements,
error walk-throughs) — in the language the user writes in.** A German owner gets
the whole journey in German; the skill files themselves stay English. The
verbatim message templates below are content specs, not required English wording.

Default house stack: **Astro (static) → GitHub → Cloudflare Pages**. Six questions
decide everything downstream — ask them in order, offer the examples so a
non-expert can answer, and record the answers in the project `README.md`.

1. **Pages + content types — what does the sitemap look like?**
   *Decides: plain pages vs Content Collections.*
   - A handful of fixed pages (home, services, about, contact, imprint — ≤ ~15)
     → plain `.astro` pages. Example: a small-business brochure site.
   - Anything that repeats with the same shape — blog posts, events, case
     studies, team members → Astro **Content Collections** (one schema, one
     template, n entries) + the `Base` layout. Example: an event archive where
     every event has date/speaker/location.
   - Mixing both is normal: flat pages + one collection.

2. **Any dynamic/backend behaviour — what must a server actually do?**
   *Decides: the Cloudflare tier. Pick the LOWEST tier that fits — going higher
   is the classic mistake. Tier tree + limits: `references/WEBSITE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.*
   - Visitors only read; contact is `mailto:` or a form service → **Tier 1
     static** (~90% of sites).
   - Exactly one small server task — a form that emails you, site search,
     hiding a third-party API key, one live widget (e.g. a next-event box fed
     by an API) → **Tier 2** (one Pages Function or server island).
   - State per user — accounts/login, a database, checkout, user-generated
     content → **Tier 3** (SSR + D1). Rare; challenge the requirement first.

3. **Who edits content after launch?**
   *Decides: CMS or not.*
   - The owner/Claude editing files in git → **no CMS** (default; markdown +
     redeploy is the workflow).
   - A non-technical person (client, co-organizer writing posts) →
     **Keystatic** (git-based, no separate backend). Can be added later —
     don't install it speculatively. When chosen, run **`keystatic-setup`**
     (local mode; the GitHub cloud-mode upgrade is documented there).

4. **One language or several?**
   *Decides: i18n routing from day 1 or never.*
   - One language (German-only counts) → skip i18n entirely.
   - Two+ **at launch** (e.g. a DE+EN consultancy site) → run
     **`astro-i18n-setup`** (Astro i18n: clean default locale + prefixed others,
     self-referencing hreflang + `x-default`, sitemap alternates, language switcher,
     per-locale test harness).
   - **Multilingual, but building one language first?** Fine — keep the default locale
     **unprefixed** from day 1, ship/test the primary language, then run
     **`astro-i18n-setup`** to add the second locale when translations are ready. Because
     the default stays at `/`, that's additive, not a breaking retrofit (skill →
     *Phased rollout*).
   - "Maybe English someday" → treat as one language now; the unprefixed default keeps a
     future second locale additive. **The only costly change is later moving the default
     off `/`** (e.g. `/` → `/en/`).

4a. **What language should the content actually be written in?**
    *Decides: the copy language — a separate decision from Q4's routing question above.*
    Answering "one language" in Q4 does **not** mean English. The starter defaults to
    English (`templates/astro/src/config.ts` ships `locale: 'en'`, and the placeholder
    homepage copy is English prose) — say so explicitly if you want German, or another
    language, instead. **German-only is a completely valid, common answer** here, not
    just "English, obviously, unless multilingual."

5. **Analytics — will anyone act on the numbers? (optional)**
   - Just "is anyone visiting?" → **Google Search Console** alone (free, no
     script, no consent banner) is enough for search & referral traffic.
   - Real decisions from traffic data (campaigns, content strategy) →
     **Plausible** (cookieless, privacy-friendly, no consent banner needed).
     If you run a **self-hosted** Plausible instance, point at it; otherwise
     recommend the **paid cloud version** (from **€9/mo** —
     https://plausible.io/#pricing) so the client runs no server.
   - Prefer cookieless tools over Google Analytics, which would pull in a
     cookie-consent banner — for German-market sites the statute behind that
     banner is § 25 TDDDG (formerly TTDSG). Third-party additions kill the
     banner-free claim by different routes: a YouTube iframe triggers § 25
     itself (device storage/readout), while remote Google Fonts flip the
     answer via the GDPR instead (unconsented IP disclosure — LG München I,
     3 O 17493/20; self-host fonts, as this starter does). Any analytics script is gated to the production branch only. The
     privacy page must match whatever is chosen here.

6. **Domain + how do changes go live? (publish model)**
   *Decides: the publish workflow — a safety-vs-simplicity trade-off. **Offer both, explain
   them, let the owner choose**; recommend two-stage. Record the choice in the README.*
   - New domain or subdomain of an existing site? (Affects canonical URLs and whether
     existing SEO authority carries over.) DNS moves to Cloudflare.
   - **Two-stage — recommended (default).** `main` is an **unlisted, noindexed preview**
     (`*.pages.dev` — noindexed, but public-by-URL, not access-controlled); `production` is
     the **live** site. The owner pushes to `main`, checks
     the preview link, then runs **`npm run ship`** to publish. A mistake never reaches the
     live domain. *Scaffold adds:* the `production` branch, the `_middleware.ts` noindex
     guard, and the `ship` script.
   - **Single-stage — simplest.** One branch — `main` is live, so every push goes straight
     to the public site. Fewer moving parts, no safety net. Pick this only for a low-stakes
     site whose owner is fine with "save = instantly public." **Note:** the `_middleware.ts`
     noindex guard de-indexes every `*.pages.dev` host, so a single-stage site is invisible
     to Google until a **custom domain** is attached — say this when recommending it.
   - **Don't assume git fluency.** Whichever they choose, hand them
     `templates/PUBLISHING.md` (plain-English `commit` / `push` / `branch` + the exact
     step-by-step to publish) and walk the **first** publish through with them.

Plain hand-written HTML (static `.html` files, no build step) is a legacy anti-pattern — use Astro.

## 2. The pipeline (the order to use the skills)

| # | Step | Skill / source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Insights: ICP, voice-of-customer, competitor scan | `customer-research` |
| 2 | Positioning: what you offer, for whom, market category → `POSITIONING.md` (Dunford) | **`website-positioning`** |
| 2a | Optional: the home page as the customer's story → `STORY.md` (offered once, §2a; positioning stays the source of truth) | `website-story` |
| 3 | Tone of Voice, EEAT, page inventory → `CONTENT_GUIDE.md` + `BRAND.md` | **`website-content-guide`** |
| 4 | Pages, clean URLs, nav, internal links | `site-architecture` |
| 5 | Decision interview + scaffold the repo | **this skill** §1, §3 |
| 6 | Build: mobile graphics, dark mode, theme tokens | **`website-design-system`** |
| 6 | Build: head metadata within limits, schema, llms.txt | **`website-seo-geo`** (+ `schema-markup`, `ai-seo`) |
| 6 | Build: per-page OG share cards (`npm run og` → 1200×630 ≤300 KB, tested) | **`og-images`** |
| 6 | Build: testimonials / Review schema from one data file (if the site has quotes) | **`website-testimonials`** |
| 7 | QA: a11y (light+dark) / seo / navigation / anchors / orphans / images / tone / positioning / email / links | **`website-qa`** |
| 8 | Performance: Lighthouse / PageSpeed for FCP & LCP | **`website-qa`** perf section (+ `seo-audit`) |
| 9 | **Double-Knuth review** (correctness + cross-file consistency) | **`website-review`** |
| 10 | Outgoing-link liveness sweep — **only if the site links out** (see §3a) | **`outgoing-link-audit`** |
| 10b | Internal-link sweep — orphaned + thin pages (run if the site grew past a handful of pages) | **`internal-link-audit`** |
| 11 | Launch & handoff: schema/sitemap/robots, deploy, hand over | **this skill** §4 |
| 12 | Post-launch: register with Google Search Console + Bing, submit sitemap, enable IndexNow | **`search-console-setup`** |
| 13 | Post-launch: claim Google Business Profile + Bing Places, verify `sameAs` profiles resolve — **only if the site is a claimable entity** (see §4a) | **`business-listings-setup`** |

Work out **positioning** (step 2) *before* any content or SEO — it decides what the
copy is even trying to say. Build the Content Guide (step 3) *before* writing page
copy; positioning and voice are inputs to everything downstream, not an afterthought.

The build is **test-driven, not test-after**: the suite is green from commit 1,
and steps 6–7 run as a loop per page (red → green → commit, see §3 step 5 and
`website-qa` §1b). Step 7 in the table is the *final full-suite gate*, not the
first time tests run.

## 2a. Story layer — offer once, right after positioning

`website-story` is optional and the owner has usually never heard of it, so explain
before asking. Once `POSITIONING.md` is filled (step 2) and before the content guide
(step 3):

1. Read **"The offer"** in `website-story/SKILL.md` and say it in the language the
   owner writes in (it explains the idea in plain words: the visitor as the hero, the
   brand as the guide, a one-liner, a three-step plan, one repeated call to action,
   positioning unchanged). Do not paraphrase it into jargon.
2. Ask once — a structured user-input tool if the platform offers one (Claude Code's
   **`AskUserQuestion`**), otherwise in chat — with two options: **Yes, build the home
   page as a story** / **No, standard home page (default)**.
3. **Yes** → run `website-story` now, before step 3, so `CONTENT_GUIDE.md`'s home row
   and `copywriting` read `STORY.md`.
4. **No, or no answer** → say nothing more about it. The skill still travels with the
   repo (§3 step 3), so it can be run later whenever the owner asks.
5. **Record the answer either way** ("home page: story-led, see STORY.md" or "home page:
   standard, story layer declined") with the decision-interview answers when §3 writes
   the project README, so a later session knows the offer was made and does not ask
   again.

Ask exactly once per build. Never run it unasked.

## 3. Scaffold the project (handoff-ready)

**Prerequisites (one-time).** Walk the user through `templates/SETUP.md` if needed —
Node/git/gh/wrangler + image tools, a **private GitHub** account, a **Cloudflare**
account. The accounts are a human action the agent cannot do. When the owner sets up
GitHub, tell them plainly that the account and the website in it are theirs, and recommend
two-factor sign-in with a passkey to keep others out (`SETUP.md` §1 has the link); for
Cloudflare, which decides whether the site is online, the same with a security key or the
device's fingerprint or face unlock. Recommend, never require: GitHub makes it mandatory only
for some accounts, and Cloudflare leaves it optional unless an account's administrator
enforces it for members.

Assemble the project at `<site>/` so it travels without any global setup:

0. **Git first, before any code:**
   ```bash
   # Resolve where the suite is installed (the cp SOURCE). Per tool:
   #   ~/.claude/skills = Claude Code · ~/.agents/skills = Codex · ~/.gemini/config/skills = Antigravity
   # Honour an explicit $SKILLS_ROOT; else auto-detect in priority order
   # Claude Code → Antigravity → Codex (Claude is the default/primary). On a machine with
   # more than one installed, set it yourself — e.g. `export SKILLS_ROOT=~/.agents/skills`
   # (Codex) or `~/.gemini/config/skills` (Antigravity); Antigravity workspace installs use
   # `export SKILLS_ROOT="$PWD/.agents/skills"`.
   if [ -z "${SKILLS_ROOT:-}" ]; then
     SKILLS_ROOT="$HOME/.claude/skills"
     for d in "$HOME/.claude/skills" "$HOME/.gemini/config/skills" "$HOME/.agents/skills"; do
       [ -d "$d/new-website" ] && SKILLS_ROOT="$d" && break
     done
   fi
   # Where bundled skills go IN the generated project (the cp DESTINATION). Claude default
   # (.claude/skills). Codex and Antigravity read repo-scoped skills from .agents/skills, so
   # derive that when the suite was installed through either of them. Force it with:
   # export PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR=.agents/skills
   if [ -z "${PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR:-}" ]; then
     case "$SKILLS_ROOT" in
       "$HOME/.agents/skills"*|"$HOME/.gemini/config/skills"*|*/.agents/skills*) PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR=".agents/skills" ;;
       *) PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR=".claude/skills" ;;
     esac
   fi
   mkdir <site> && cd <site> && git init
   cp "$SKILLS_ROOT"/new-website/templates/.gitignore .
   git add .gitignore && git commit -m "chore: init repo with .gitignore"
   ```
1. **Scaffold + overlay:** `npm create astro@latest .` (Empty, TS strict), then copy
   the `templates/astro/` overlay (`src/`, `tests/`, `public/`, `functions/`,
   `scripts/`, `.github/`, `.nvmrc`, root configs — see `templates/astro/README.md`
   for exact steps and npm deps). Set the real domain in `astro.config.mjs` (`site:`)
   and `src/config.ts`. **Set `SITE.locale` in `src/config.ts` to match the interview's
   Q4a content-language answer** (and `lang` in `Base.astro` too, if not running
   `astro-i18n-setup`). **`'de'` flips the footer's privacy link to `/datenschutz`** —
   do the privacy→datenschutz swap in the SAME step (rename the in-repo
   draft `src/pages/_datenschutz.astro` per its header: page file,
   `tests/_helpers.ts` PAGES, `public/llms.txt`, `OWN_CARD_EXEMPT` +
   `POSITIONING_EXEMPT` in the specs) or every intermediate `npm test` fails
   navigation on the footer link.
   The overlay ships `locale: 'en'`, and leaving that default in
   place for a German-content (or other non-English) site is exactly the silent-default
   bug Q4a exists to catch. **Astro needs Node ≥22.12** — the overlay's `.nvmrc` pins
   22 for local + Cloudflare Pages builds.
2. **Permissions + working rules.** Copy the setup guide into the project (all tools), then — **Claude Code
   only** — copy the allowlist so routine `npm`/`astro`/`playwright`/`git commit` calls don't
   prompt (it still asks for `rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `wrangler … delete`, `gh repo delete`):
   ```bash
   cp "$SKILLS_ROOT"/new-website/templates/SETUP.md .          # all tools — receiving party can set up too
   cp "$SKILLS_ROOT"/new-website/templates/PUBLISHING.md .     # owner "how to publish" + assistant deploy guardrails
   cp "$SKILLS_ROOT"/new-website/templates/AGENTS.md .         # working rules for every assistant (Codex + Claude)
   cp "$SKILLS_ROOT"/new-website/templates/CLAUDE.md .         # one line: @AGENTS.md
   # Claude Code only:
   mkdir -p .claude
   cp "$SKILLS_ROOT"/new-website/templates/claude/settings.json .claude/settings.json
   ```
   *Codex / Antigravity: skip the `.claude/settings.json` copy — it's Claude Code-specific.
   Use their own approval systems instead (Codex: `AGENTS.md` + Codex rules/config;
   Antigravity: its sandbox approval model).* For Claude's allow/deny model and how to extend
   it safely when a prompt keeps recurring, use **`website-permissions`**.
   **Fill `AGENTS.md` now**, per the scaffold note at its top: site name, live URL, the
   preview URL (two-stage: `main.<project>.pages.dev`; single-stage: "pull-request
   previews only, `<branch>.<project>.pages.dev`" — `main` is live there; update the
   project name if Cloudflare later forces another one), `[TITLE_SUFFIX]` = the
   ` | {SITE.name}` string `Base.astro` appends, `[SUFFIX_LENGTH]` = its length, and
   `[TITLE_MAX]` = 60 minus that length; keep ONE publish-model block in its §2 (the
   interview's Q6 answer) and delete the other. §5 (collaborators, rights level, merge
   rule, who publishes) ships with single-owner defaults, not slots; `website-team-setup`
   rewrites it when a team forms. Non-English owner: translate `AGENTS.md` in-session
   like `PUBLISHING.md` — rules and commands intact.
3. **Skills travel with the repo** — copy the twenty-four always-on skills in, plus any
   conditional setup skills selected by the interview, so the handoffs resolve for the
   receiving party. "Always-on" here means always **copied** into the project, not
   necessarily always **run**: `business-listings-setup` travels with every repo but
   only executes when §4a's gate says the site is a claimable entity — it still needs
   to be in the repo so a later session can run it once that's true. The always-on set is the
   seven core `website-*` siblings, `website-positioning-check` (always copied, optional to run),
   the three SEO-depth skills they delegate to — `ai-seo`, `schema-markup`,
   `seo-audit` — `site-architecture` (IA), the three
   marketing skills the pipeline delegates to — `customer-research`, `copywriting`,
   `image` — plus `outgoing-link-audit` (external link sweep), `internal-link-audit`
   (orphan/thin-page sweep), `og-images` (per-page share cards),
   `website-permissions` (allowlist),
   `search-console-setup` (post-launch GSC/Bing/IndexNow),
   `business-listings-setup` (post-launch Business Profile/Bing Places/
   `sameAs` — gated per §4a), `website-motion` (optional polish — copied so
   the recipient can opt in later; it never runs on its own), `website-story`
   (optional story layer — same rule: copied, never runs unasked; offered once at §2a),
   and `website-team-setup` (copied so the day a second person joins, the session that
   sets up the team finds it; it never runs on its own either):
   `$SKILLS_ROOT` entries are often symlinks (e.g. a `make install` checkout
   symlinks each skill from this suite repo) — use `cp -RL` to dereference
   them, not `cp -R`, or the copy ships broken symlinks pointing back at the
   developer's own machine instead of a self-contained skill directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR"
   cp -RL "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-positioning \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-positioning-check \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-content-guide \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-seo-geo \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-design-system \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-testimonials \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-qa \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-review \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/ai-seo \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/schema-markup \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/seo-audit \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/site-architecture \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/customer-research \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/copywriting \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/image \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/outgoing-link-audit \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/internal-link-audit \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/og-images \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-permissions \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/search-console-setup \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/business-listings-setup \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-motion \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-story \
         "$SKILLS_ROOT"/website-team-setup \
         "$PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR"/
   ```
   The global copies stay the updateable source of truth; the project copies are
   the frozen handoff set.

   **Conditional setup skills** — run the matching line ONLY when the interview
   selected it (they don't ship with a declared one-language, CMS-free site;
   a multilingual-PHASED site is single-locale at scaffold time and still
   gets astro-i18n-setup):
   ```bash
   # If Q3 = "non-technical editor" (Keystatic):
   cp -RL "$SKILLS_ROOT"/keystatic-setup "$PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR"/
   # If Q4 = "2+ languages at launch" OR "multilingual, one language first"
   # (phased rollout): the phased site NEEDS the skill vendored from day 1 —
   # its Phase 2 instruction is "run astro-i18n-setup when translations are
   # ready", which can't resolve if the skill was never copied.
   cp -RL "$SKILLS_ROOT"/astro-i18n-setup "$PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR"/
   ```

   **Sanity check** (always, once all copying above — the primary batch AND
   any conditional skills — is complete) — confirm nothing was copied as a
   symlink:
   ```bash
   find "$PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type l
   # Must print nothing. Any output means a skill copied as a symlink, not a
   # real directory — the handoff repo would ship broken links back to this
   # machine. Re-run the copy for the listed name(s) with cp -RL.
   ```

   **Stamp the copies** (always, after ALL skills are copied) — records which suite
   state they came from, so `make whats-new PROJECT=<site>` in the suite repo can later
   report which bundled skills have upstream updates:
   ```bash
   # The suite's scripts/whats-new.sh is the ONLY writer of the stamp format. Resolve
   # the suite clone via the symlink and verify it really is the suite — a copied
   # (non-symlink) install sitting inside some other git repo must NOT stamp that
   # repo's HEAD.
   SUITE_SRC="$(readlink "$SKILLS_ROOT/new-website" 2>/dev/null || echo "$SKILLS_ROOT/new-website")"
   SUITE_REPO="$(git -C "$SUITE_SRC" rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || true)"
   if [ -n "$SUITE_REPO" ] && [ -f "$SUITE_REPO/scripts/whats-new.sh" ] \
      && [ -d "$SUITE_REPO/skills/new-website" ]; then
     bash "$SUITE_REPO/scripts/whats-new.sh" --stamp "$PROJECT_SKILLS_DIR"
     # Also stamp the FROZEN template copies (tests/*.spec.ts, CONTENT_GUIDE.md):
     # whats-new reports their upstream drift separately — --refresh never touches
     # them, they're merged by hand (they may carry site edits like the PAGES list).
     bash "$SUITE_REPO/scripts/whats-new.sh" --stamp-tests tests

   fi
   ```
4. **Docs** — copy `templates/positioning.md` → `POSITIONING.md`,
   `templates/content-guide.md` → `CONTENT_GUIDE.md` and `templates/brand.md` →
   `BRAND.md`; fill the `[BRACKET]` slots in pipeline steps 2–3. `STORY.md` exists
   only if the owner opted in at §2a; `website-story` copies it from its own
   `templates/story.md`.
5. **Confirm green:** `npm run build && npm test` (the overlay passes the
   a11y/seo/navigation/anchors/orphans/images/tone/positioning/email/links/llms-coverage/middleware suite out of the box). Then build pages
   test-first: add the route to `tests/_helpers.ts` `PAGES` *before* writing the
   page (suite goes red), build until green, commit. New features get their test
   first too — `website-qa` §1b maps feature → test.

## 3a. Outgoing-link sweep — ask, but only if the site links out

The offline `tests/links.spec.ts` guard ships in the suite and runs in CI from commit
1 — nothing to decide there. The **liveness** sweep (`outgoing-link-audit`) is
network-dependent and optional, so gate it on whether the built site actually has
external links, and let the user choose:

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
[ -d dist ] || npm run build >/dev/null
SITE_HOST=$(grep -oE "site:[[:space:]]*['\"]https?://[^'\"]+" astro.config.mjs \
  | sed -E "s#.*://(www\.)?##; s#/.*##" | head -1)
EXT=$(grep -rhoE '<a [^>]*href="https?://[^"]+"' dist --include='*.html' \
  | grep -oE 'href="https?://[^"]+"' | sed -E 's/^href="//; s/"$//' \
  | grep -vE "://(www\.)?${SITE_HOST}(/|$|:)" | sort -u | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
```

- **`EXT` is 0** → the site links only to itself. Say so and **skip silently** — do
  not ask.
- **`EXT` ≥ 1** → ask whether to run the liveness sweep now — use a structured
  user-input tool if the platform offers one (Claude Code's **`AskUserQuestion`**),
  otherwise just ask in chat — e.g. *"The site has N outgoing links. Run the `outgoing-link-audit` liveness
  sweep before launch? (fetches each third-party URL; ~a few seconds each)"* — options
  **Run it now (recommended)** / **Skip — I'll run it monthly**. If they say run it,
  invoke the `outgoing-link-audit` skill; otherwise note it as a monthly follow-up.

## 4. Launch & handoff checklist

### Deploy-time guardrails — `templates/PUBLISHING.md` § "For AI assistants — deploy-time guardrails"

That section is the single source of truth — §3 copies `PUBLISHING.md` into every site, so
the post-handoff agent carries it too (the scaffolded README's deploy section points there).
Read it in full before the FIRST deploy, when a brand-new page goes live, and when a live
URL looks stale; this summary covers routine pushes.
**Always announce whether a push is PREVIEW or LIVE** (two-stage sites: "this
is NOT live yet" + the preview URL on every push to `main`; live only after
`npm run ship` AND the production build finishes). **Never request — or
announce — a brand-new page's URL on the live domain before its build is
Active**: the first request — the owner clicking your announcement counts —
caches a 404 at the edge that only a manual dashboard purge clears. Verify on
the hash deployment URL until Active, touch the bare canonical URL last, and
hold Search Console Request Indexing until then.

- [ ] All QA green: `npm test`.
- [ ] **Nothing left unshipped** (two-stage sites): `git log origin/production..origin/main`
      is empty — merged-but-unpromoted work is invisibly unshipped. If not empty and it
      should ship: `npm run ship` (which also VERIFIES the live site serves the new build
      via `/build.txt` — push alone is not proof of live).
- [ ] **Double-Knuth review clean** (`website-review`): both passes — run it as the final
      gate AND after adding the last page.
- [ ] Lighthouse / PageSpeed run; FCP & LCP within target (see `website-qa`).
- [ ] **Outgoing links healthy** (`outgoing-link-audit`) — only if the site links out
      (§3a). No DEAD/REBRAND left unhandled; any retired domain added to
      `tests/links.spec.ts` `STALE_DOMAINS`.
- [ ] **No orphaned pages** — `tests/orphans.spec.ts` green (every page reachable from
      home). For a multi-page site, run `internal-link-audit` and resolve orphans + thin
      pages; deliberately-unlinked pages listed in `ORPHAN_EXEMPT` with a reason.
- [ ] `sitemap-index.xml` present; `robots.txt` + `llms.txt` accurate. (llms.txt
      *coverage* — every `PAGES` route listed, no stale entry for a removed or
      renamed page — is enforced both ways by `tests/llms-coverage.spec.ts`;
      wording accuracy stays a human check.)
- [ ] Required schema validates (Rich Results / schema.org validator).
- [ ] **OG share cards** generated (`npm run og`, the `og-images` skill): a 1200×630
      JPEG **≤300 KB** per page (`public/images/og/`), each page wiring `image=` (or the
      default). `tests/seo.spec.ts` enforces size/dimensions; WhatsApp drops previews over
      ~300 KB. Plus favicon/manifest icon set in place, and the manifest's
      `[BRACKET]` fields (name/short_name/description) filled in the site's
      content language with `lang` set from `SITE.locale` — no spec reads the
      manifest, so placeholder English there ships silently otherwise.
- [ ] Imprint/legal + privacy pages present (EEAT trust + DE legal requirement).
      The starter ships a GDPR privacy draft (`src/pages/privacy.astro`): every
      `[BRACKET]` slot filled, the analytics section matching the real setup.
      German-market sites: don't re-translate — swap in the vetted German
      drafts that ship in the site repo, whose own file headers carry the
      exact steps: `src/pages/_datenschutz.astro` (§ 25 TDDDG-aware;
      underscore = unrouted until renamed; German-only sites serve it at
      `/datenschutz` REPLACING `/privacy`, multilingual sites use its text at
      `/de/privacy`) and `src/pages/impressum.astro` (§ 5 DDG + § 18 Abs. 2
      MStV — required for providers established in Germany, whatever the
      site's language, and for sites targeting the German market; fill/delete
      per its header and section comments, which also cover Austrian/Swiss
      adaptation and the five-piece removal for providers with no German
      nexus).
- [ ] Deployed to Cloudflare Pages per the chosen **publish model** (§1 Q6).
      **Two-stage:** create the live branch (`git checkout -b production && git push -u
      origin production && git checkout main` — end back on `main`), then in Cloudflare set
      *Production branch* = `production` — so
      `main` = noindexed preview, `production` = live; analytics fires on production only.
      **Single-stage:** `main` = live (default Cloudflare production branch).
      **Creating the Pages project + first deploy** (the step a Cloudflare newcomer
      struggles with) — offer the bootstrap options in
      `references/CLOUDFLARE_FIRST_DEPLOY.md`: recommend the **token-assisted** path for
      owners new to Cloudflare (least-privilege, expiring token; you run Wrangler), with
      git-integration (push-to-deploy, no token) and browser/manual as the other offered paths.
      Either way: hand the owner `PUBLISHING.md` and walk the **first** publish with them.
      Non-English-speaking owner? Translate `PUBLISHING.md` in-session first (e.g. save
      as `PUBLISHING.de.md`, or replace the copy) — it is the owner's PERMANENT reference,
      unlike your conversational guidance, and the shipped template is English. Any
      translation or replacement MUST keep the "For AI assistants — deploy-time
      guardrails" section (translated is fine, dropped is not — it is the post-handoff
      agent's only copy of those rules).
- [ ] **`<project>.pages.dev` redirects to the live domain**: once the live domain serves
      this build, Production variable `CANONICAL_URL` set and redeployed; `curl -sI` on the
      alias shows `301` (`references/CLOUDFLARE_FIRST_DEPLOY.md`, "After go-live").
- [ ] **Search engines notified** (`search-console-setup`): live domain added to Google
      Search Console (Domain property + DNS TXT) and Bing (import from GSC),
      `sitemap-index.xml` submitted to both, and **IndexNow on** (Cloudflare Crawler
      Hints toggle). Register the production domain only — never a preview host.
- [ ] **Business listings claimed, if applicable** (`business-listings-setup`,
      §4a): `sameAs` verification done for any named entity — every URL in
      schema confirmed live or manually verified logged-out, per that skill's
      own verification rules; directories claimed where a suitable one exists
      for the category; Google Business Profile and Bing Places live only if
      the entity actually qualifies (the skill's §1 step 0 checks). "No
      relevant directory found" and "not eligible" are valid, non-blocking
      outcomes — distinct from "skipped by owner choice".
- [ ] Repo self-contained for the receiving party: `.gitignore`, `.claude/`,
      `POSITIONING.md`, `CONTENT_GUIDE.md`, `BRAND.md` (+ `STORY.md` if opted in), `tests/`, `SETUP.md`,
      `PUBLISHING.md` (with its "For AI assistants" guardrails section intact),
      `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` (no `[BRACKET]` slot left, the scaffold note removed,
      one publish-model block kept in §2), and a
      `README.md` with the decision answers + "how to add a page / run tests / deploy".

## 4a. Business listings — ask, but only if the site is a claimable entity

`business-listings-setup` claims category directories and verifies the site's
`sameAs` schema resolves — both apply to any named entity. Google Business
Profile and Bing Places are narrower: they need a real address customers visit,
or staff who travel to serve customers, which the skill's own §1 checks. Naming
the entity is enough to run the skill; it is not enough to guarantee a Google/Bing
profile will follow, and the ask below says so. Gate it the same way as the
outgoing-link sweep in §3a: check a condition, then let the user choose rather
than assuming.

- **The site has no claimable identity at all** (a personal blog with no
  business or professional practice behind it, a resource hub with no identity
  of its own) → there is nothing to claim. Say so and **skip silently** — do not
  ask. A sole proprietor or consultant who trades under their own name (a
  photographer, a freelancer) still counts as a named entity here — the test is
  "is there a business or practice to claim," not "is the name different from a
  person's."
- **The site represents a named, real-world entity** (an event series, a studio, a
  local business, a community or organization with its own name) → ask whether to
  run it now — e.g. *"This looks like a named entity (`<name>`) that could claim
  directory listings and verify its schema profiles. It may also qualify for a
  Google Business Profile if it has a real address or serves customers in
  person — the skill checks that itself. Want to set this up now? It needs a few
  clicks from you at each platform — I'll draft everything else."* — options
  **Run it now (recommended)** / **Skip — I'll do it later**. If they say run it,
  invoke the `business-listings-setup` skill; otherwise note it as a post-launch
  follow-up alongside `search-console-setup`.

## Notes

- Do not rebuild what existing skills cover — GEO depth → `ai-seo`; technical-SEO/
  Core-Web-Vitals → `seo-audit`; JSON-LD → `schema-markup`; IA → `site-architecture`;
  research → `customer-research`; copy → `copywriting`; images → `image`.
- After any code/copy edit, re-run `website-qa`. "Done" means the tests are green,
  not that the file was written.
- Run **`website-review`** (the Double-Knuth two-pass audit) at the **end of a build**
  (pre-launch) and **after adding/editing a page** — it's the cross-file consistency gate
  on top of `website-qa`'s tests (a new route can silently break `PAGES`, nav, the sitemap,
  internal links or canonical).
- **Editing the skill suite itself** (these templates, the test specs, or a sibling
  skill) is different from reviewing a site: green tests do not catch doc↔test drift,
  so run `/code-review` before trusting the change. The Double-Knuth pass that hardened
  this suite found exactly that class of issue.
