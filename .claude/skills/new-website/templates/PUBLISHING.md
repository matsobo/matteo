# Publishing your site — a plain-English guide

This explains how your changes get onto the internet. **No prior git knowledge needed** —
read the glossary once, then follow the steps for your site's model.

---

## The five words you'll see (in plain English)

| Word | What it actually means |
|---|---|
| **commit** | **Save a snapshot** of your changes on your own computer, with a short note describing them. Nothing is online yet — it's like saving a document. |
| **push** | **Upload** your saved snapshots to GitHub (the cloud). This is what triggers a build. |
| **branch** | A **named line of work**. Your site has up to two: `main` and (sometimes) `production`. Think of them as "the draft" and "the published version." |
| **checkout** | **Switch** which branch you're looking at / working on. `git checkout main` = "show me the draft." |
| **merge** | **Copy the changes** from one branch into another — e.g. take everything in `main` and bring it into `production` to publish. |

A normal edit is always the same three moves: **commit** (save) → **push** (upload) →
the site rebuilds automatically. The only question is *which branch* you push to, and that's
what your model below decides.

---

## Which model is your site? (check your README)

Your site uses **one** of these. If you're not sure, your README's "Deploy" section says
which, or just look at your branches: only `main` = single-stage; `main` **and**
`production` = two-stage.

---

## Two-stage (recommended) — "preview first, then publish"

`main` is an **unlisted, noindexed preview**; `production` is the **live** site. You can
push freely to `main` — nothing reaches your live domain until you publish. (Search engines
are told to ignore the preview, but it isn't password-protected: **anyone who has the preview
URL can open it.** Don't put confidential content on a preview unless the project is behind
Cloudflare Access or similar.)

**Every time you change the site:**

```bash
# 1. Save your changes (a snapshot + a short description)
git add -A
git commit -m "describe what you changed, e.g. update opening hours"

# 2. Upload them — this builds your NOINDEXED PREVIEW (not on the live domain yet)
git push

# 3. Look at the preview. Open the preview link from Cloudflare
#    (stable address: main.<your-project>.pages.dev) and check it's right.

# 4. Happy? Publish it to the live site — ONE command:
npm run ship
```

`npm run ship` uploads `main` to the live (`production`) branch for you — you never run the
branch commands by hand. Then it **waits and verifies** that the live site really serves the
new version (every build stamps its id into `/build.txt`; ship polls for it, up to 4 min).
"✓ LIVE — verified" means it's truly online; a warning means Cloudflare didn't build — the
message tells you exactly what to click. Never assume a push went live without that check.

> **Each upload may run a quick self-check** (it builds the site and runs the tests before
> uploading — so does `npm run ship`, which uploads too). It can take a minute, and **if
> something is broken it stops the upload and tells you** rather than publishing a broken
> page. To skip the check on a *manual* `git push` you've already verified:
> `git push --no-verify`. If **`npm run ship`** stops partway, don't force it — ask for help.

> **Nothing reaches the live domain until step 4.** Steps 1–3 only update the noindexed preview.

---

## Single-stage (simplest) — "push = live"

One branch, `main`, and it **is** the live site. There's no preview — every upload goes
straight online. Simple, but there's no safety net, so check locally first (`npm run dev`).

> **"Push = live" is a promise, not a fact.** Cloudflare can silently stop building (it
> happened in production: green pushes, no deploy). After an important upload, confirm the
> change is really online — `curl https://your-site/build.txt` shows which build is serving
> (compare with `git rev-parse HEAD`). If it's stale: Cloudflare dashboard → your project →
> Deployments (retry the failed build, or re-connect GitHub under Settings → Builds).

> **You need a custom domain for Google to see the site.** A bare Cloudflare
> `*.pages.dev` URL is **noindexed by design** (so stray preview URLs never get indexed).
> Until you attach your real domain in Cloudflare, the live site works but search engines
> ignore it. Once your real domain shows the new site, your assistant switches the
> `pages.dev` address to forward visitors there, so a link to it in an AI answer still
> brings people to your real domain.

**Every time you change the site:**

```bash
# 1. (Optional but wise) preview locally first
npm run dev        # opens a local copy in your browser; Ctrl-C to stop

# 2. Save your changes
git add -A
git commit -m "describe what you changed"

# 3. Upload — this goes LIVE within a minute
git push
```

## If something goes wrong

- **Mistake already live?** Don't panic — in the **Cloudflare dashboard → your Pages
  project → Deployments**, every past version is listed; click an older one →
  **Rollback** to restore it instantly.
- **Made a typo in the last save (not pushed yet)?** Re-edit, then
  `git add -A && git commit -m "fix typo"` again.
- **`git push` says "rejected"?** (on `main`) Someone/something updated the cloud copy — run
  `git pull` first, then `git push` again.

`npm run ship` names which of these it is, and stops before publishing anything. The
ones you're most likely to meet:

- **"Couldn't reach GitHub"** or **"couldn't fetch from GitHub"?** Your internet, not your
  site. Nothing was published. Wait a moment and run `npm run ship` again.
- **"GitHub has changes that aren't on your computer yet"?** Someone (or another
  computer) saved work you don't have. Run `git pull`, look at the site, then ship again —
  publishing without it would put an **older** version live.
- **"Publish blocked — 'production' has commits that 'main' doesn't have"?** The live
  branch has history your preview doesn't. **Don't force anything** — ask for help. This
  one is rare and worth a second pair of eyes.
- **"The connection to GitHub dropped part-way through the upload"?** Genuinely unclear whether it
  landed, so the script won't guess. Just run `npm run ship` again: if it already landed,
  git says "Everything up-to-date" and the checks carry on as normal.
- **"The push failed, for a reason this script can't name"?** Read the error printed just
  above it — most often your own tests failed, and the site is fine until you fix them.
- **"Your copy and GitHub's have BOTH changed"?** You edited here, something else edited
  there. Run `git pull --no-rebase` (the flag matters — a plain `git pull` refuses to
  guess when both sides moved), and if it mentions a **conflict**, ask for help rather
  than guessing. Then `git push`, then ship.
- **"'production' moved while this was publishing"?** Rare, and harmless: something
  published between the check and the upload. Run `npm run ship` again — it re-checks
  and will tell you plainly if anything is actually wrong.
- **"'git fetch' failed, and not for a network reason"?** Not a blip — running it again
  won't help. Read git's own error printed above it; a missing connection to GitHub or
  an expired login both land here.
- **"This branch isn't connected to GitHub yet"?** A brand-new site that has never been
  uploaded. Run `git push -u origin main` once, then ship.

When in doubt, ask before you `npm run ship` / `git push` — those are the only two commands
that change what the public sees.

## For AI assistants — deploy-time guardrails

*This section is written for an AI assistant working in this repo — from here on, "you"
means the assistant. Owner: you can skim it; it explains why the assistant is careful with
links. Assistant: these rules apply to **every** publish, from the site's first deploy on,
not just while it was being built. If this file ever gets translated or rewritten for the
owner, this section must survive the rewrite — translating it is fine, dropping it is not.
The direct `git push` steps above are the OWNER's path; you work through pull requests,
per `AGENTS.md` §2.*

### Always say whether it's PREVIEW or LIVE

A non-technical owner cannot tell a preview URL from the live site. So **every time** you
push to `main` (or they do), state it explicitly — never let a preview read as live:

> ✅ Your changes are on the **preview**: `https://main.<project>.pages.dev` — **this is NOT
> live yet.** When it looks right, run `npm run ship` to publish to `<live-domain>`.

Only after `npm run ship` (or the merge into `production`) **and** the Cloudflare production
build finishes is it actually live at `<live-domain>`. After `npm run ship` prints
"✓ LIVE — verified" (it polls `/build.txt` until the live site serves the new SHA), announce
it live on that result — no manual re-check needed. For a plain merge into `production` — or
when ship reports it could not verify — confirm manually before announcing ("✅ now live
at …"). On a **single-stage** site there is no preview: say plainly that the push **is
going live now**. Deliver these announcements in the owner's language, like everything else
you say to them.

**Which URL to quote.** Prefer the **memorable `pages.dev` alias** — the branch alias
`main.<project>.pages.dev` (or, before go-live, the project alias `<project>.pages.dev` —
after go-live it redirects to the live domain) — over the random
per-deploy hash URL `<hash>.<project>.pages.dev`. The hash URL is ugly but **immutable**, so
keep it as a **backup**: when an alias looks **stale** (cache/propagation lag, or it's still
serving an older build), the hash URL pins the exact fresh deployment and confirms the new
build is up. For a **brand-new page**, though, the next section wins: until the production
build is Active, the page exists only on the hash URL. Whichever URL you quote, **open it
and confirm it loads** rather than reporting it blind — and note it for the project.
(A `pages.dev` URL is also the signal you deployed to **Pages**, not a Worker — if a deploy
ever prints a `*.workers.dev` URL, stop: you published the wrong project type.)

### Never request a page on the live domain before its build is Active

The edge caches whatever it first sees. If anyone — you, the owner's browser, a link
checker — requests a brand-new path on the live domain while the production build is still
running, a zone cache rule (Cache Everything on HTML) will cache the **404**, and a cached
404 does not reliably self-heal: observed surviving `cf-cache-status: HIT` more than 90
minutes past a 30-minute `max-age`, immune to plain re-requests. Only a **manual dashboard
purge** clears it (Cloudflare dashboard → the zone → Caching → Purge Cache → custom purge by
URL; wrangler's OAuth token has `zone (read)` only and cannot purge programmatically). So:

- Until the production deployment shows **Active**, verify new pages ONLY on the hash
  deployment URL (`<hash>.<project>.pages.dev`) — pre-Active the live domain still serves
  the *previous* deployment, so a brand-new path 404s there no matter how you request it.
  Check Active status without touching the live domain: `wrangler pages deployment list`,
  the `<project>.pages.dev` alias (Cloudflare's own domain, outside the zone cache — but
  only before go-live; once `CANONICAL_URL` is set it redirects to the live domain, so
  don't follow it), or ask the owner — NEVER poll the live custom domain to see whether the build is done.
  (`npm run ship`'s built-in check is the one exception: it polls `/build.txt` — a path
  that exists in every build — with a cache-bust.) Once Active, check the live domain with a
  `?cb=<anything>` cache-bust first (under default cache settings that is a distinct cache
  key, so it cannot poison the bare URL).
- Touch the **bare canonical URL last**, after Active — and only then tell the owner the
  link is safe to open. Announcing a URL before Active invites the owner to click it —
  and that first request makes the edge cache the 404 for everyone.
- The same applies to Search Console **Request Indexing**: Googlebot is served the same
  edge cache, so requesting indexing while a stale 404 is cached shows Google exactly the
  wrong thing.
- If a 404 does get cached anyway: ask the owner to run the single-URL purge in the
  Cloudflare dashboard (a human-only step — the assistant has no dashboard access; path
  above), then re-verify.
