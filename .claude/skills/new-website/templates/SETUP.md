# Setup: accounts, tools, git, and Claude permissions

One-time machine setup for building/deploying the sites this skill scaffolds. Copy this
file into a handed-off repo so the receiving party can get running too.

---

## 1. Accounts to create (human action — Claude can't do these)

1. **GitHub — a PRIVATE account/repo.** https://github.com/signup. Client work stays in
   **private** repos. Run `gh auth login` (see tools) so pushes need no password.
   **Recommended: protect the account.** The account and the website in it are yours, and
   whoever gets into the account can change or delete the site. At
   https://github.com/settings/security, turn on **two-factor authentication** and add a
   **passkey** (sign in with fingerprint, face or phone; with two-factor on, a passkey covers
   both steps at once). Optional unless GitHub asks for it: GitHub requires two-factor only
   for some accounts, and tells those by email and on the site.
2. **Cloudflare account.** https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up. Hosts the site
   (Pages) and, if you move the domain's DNS there, the DNS. Free tier (unmetered bandwidth)
   covers a small static site; upgrade to Workers Paid ($5/mo) only when a feature needs it.
   **Recommended: protect this account too.** It decides whether your website is online and,
   with the DNS here, where your domain points. In the dashboard, **My Profile →
   Authentication**, turn on **two-factor authentication**; a security key is the strongest
   choice, and your device's own fingerprint or face unlock (Touch ID, Android fingerprint,
   Windows Hello) counts as one; an authenticator app or email codes also work. Optional
   unless your Cloudflare account's administrator requires it: Cloudflare offers it at
   sign-in and lets you skip.

## 2. Tools to install

### macOS — via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
```bash
brew install node          # JS runtime + npm — runs Astro, the build, the tests
brew install git           # version control (the deploy = "push to GitHub")
brew install gh            # GitHub CLI — create repos & push from the terminal
npm  install -g wrangler   # Cloudflare CLI — local Functions preview & manual deploys

# image optimisation (see website-design-system)
brew install webp          # cwebp/dwebp — PNG/JPG → WebP
brew install libavif       # avifenc — → AVIF (smallest modern format)
brew install oxipng        # lossless PNG shrink (favicons/icons)
npm  install -g svgo       # minify SVGs (npm, not brew — needs node, above)
brew install jpegoptim     # optimise JPEGs
brew install exiftool      # strip EXIF/GPS from photos before publishing (privacy)
brew install imagemagick   # `magick` — resize/crop/convert, build responsive sizes
pip3 install Pillow        # OG share-card generator (`npm run og`); see og-images skill

# Markdown reader/editor (read & edit CONTENT_GUIDE.md, BRAND.md, README, etc.)
brew install --cask obsidian   # free Markdown editor (point a vault at the repo folder)

# per machine, once (re-run after a Playwright upgrade):
npx playwright install chromium   # the headless browser the tests drive
```

### Windows — via [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/) (built into Win 11)
```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS      # Node + npm
winget install Git.Git                # git
winget install GitHub.cli             # gh
npm  install -g wrangler              # Cloudflare CLI
winget install ImageMagick.ImageMagick # `magick` — convert/resize, incl. WebP & AVIF
winget install Python.Python.3.13      # Python — runtime for the OG share-card generator
py -m pip install Pillow               # OG share-card generator (`npm run og`); see og-images skill
npm  install -g svgo                   # minify SVGs
winget install OliverBetz.ExifTool     # strip EXIF/GPS (verify id; or download the .exe)
winget install Obsidian.Obsidian       # Markdown reader/editor
# cwebp/dwebp CLIs: download libwebp from Google if needed — otherwise `magick` does WebP.
# oxipng / jpegoptim: optional on Windows; `magick` covers PNG/JPEG optimisation + AVIF.
npx playwright install chromium        # per machine, once
```
> On Windows, prefer building/testing inside **WSL2 (Ubuntu)** for parity with Cloudflare's
> Linux build environment — fewer line-ending/path surprises. If you build in WSL2, install
> the tools with the macOS/Linux commands above (including `pip3 install Pillow`) inside the
> WSL2 shell, not the PowerShell ones.

> **Node ≥22.12 required** (Astro's own floor) — the LTS installs above satisfy it; the repo's
> `.nvmrc` pins 22 for local + Cloudflare Pages. On **npm ≥11.16**, `npm install` warns
> "packages have install scripts not yet covered" for scripts it hasn't been told to trust
> — per npm's own docs this is currently advisory only (the scripts still run; a future
> npm release will start blocking them), but approve the one Astro needs now to silence the
> warning and be ready ahead of that: `npm approve-scripts esbuild`. (sharp used to need
> this too; since sharp 0.35 it ships prebuilt binaries with no install script, so there is
> nothing to approve.)
> Approvals are pinned to the exact version reviewed (npm's own default, by design) — a future
> `astro` bump that pulls a different esbuild version will re-surface this same warning;
> just re-run the same command.

### What each tool does
| Tool | Function |
|---|---|
| node / npm | Runs Astro, builds the site, runs the test suite. |
| git | Version control; the deploy is "push to GitHub". |
| gh | Create the GitHub repo + push without a browser. |
| wrangler | Cloudflare CLI — `wrangler pages dev` local Functions, manual deploys. |
| @playwright/test | Drives a real browser for the tests (per-project dev dep). |
| @axe-core/playwright | WCAG accessibility scanner inside Playwright (per-project dev dep). |
| cwebp / avifenc | Convert raster images to WebP / AVIF. |
| imagemagick (`magick`) | Resize/crop/convert; generate the responsive size set. |
| oxipng / jpegoptim / svgo | Squeeze PNG / JPG / SVG. |
| exiftool | Strip camera EXIF + GPS from photos (privacy). |
| Obsidian | Read/edit the repo's Markdown docs (`CONTENT_GUIDE.md`, `BRAND.md`, READMEs) with live preview — open the site folder as a vault. Free; macOS + Windows. (VS Code's built-in Markdown preview also works if you'd rather not add an app.) |

## 3. Bootstrap git + .gitignore FIRST (before any code)

Initialise version control **before** scaffolding, so secrets and `node_modules` can never
be committed by accident:
```bash
mkdir <site> && cd <site>
git init
# Where the suite is installed: ~/.claude/skills (Claude Code) · ~/.agents/skills (Codex)
# · ~/.gemini/config/skills (Antigravity). Honour an explicit $SKILLS_ROOT; else auto-detect.
if [ -z "${SKILLS_ROOT:-}" ]; then
  SKILLS_ROOT="$HOME/.claude/skills"
  for d in "$HOME/.claude/skills" "$HOME/.gemini/config/skills" "$HOME/.agents/skills"; do
    [ -d "$d/new-website" ] && SKILLS_ROOT="$d" && break
  done
fi
cp "$SKILLS_ROOT/new-website/templates/.gitignore" .
git add .gitignore && git commit -m "chore: init repo with .gitignore"
```
The template `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.astro/`, Playwright artifacts,
`.env*` secrets, `.wrangler/`, and OS/editor cruft. **Never commit a `.env` or any token** —
Cloudflare/analytics secrets live in the Cloudflare dashboard's env vars, not the repo.

When you create the GitHub repo (`gh repo create … --private`), also turn on auto-delete of
merged PR head branches — the assistant always works through pull requests (`AGENTS.md`
§2), so this keeps stale branches from piling up from day one (GitHub never deletes a
PR's *base* branch, so long-lived staging/production branches are safe). Pair it with
fetch-time pruning so the deleted branches also disappear from local `origin/…` references
(prune only cleans tracking refs, never local branches):
```bash
gh repo edit --delete-branch-on-merge
git config --global fetch.prune true   # once per machine; use --local to scope per repo
```

### Pre-push quality gate (auto-wired by `npm install`)

The `prepare` script in `package.json` points `core.hooksPath` at `scripts/hooks`, so the
shipped **`pre-push` hook** runs the build + tests and **blocks a push that's red** — the
local enforcement of "fails → does not ship" (Cloudflare deploys independently of CI, so this
is what makes that true on a direct-push workflow). It needs `npx playwright install chromium`
(above). Relax for one push with `git push --no-verify`; disable with
`git config --unset core.hooksPath`. See `website-qa` §1c — offer this choice, don't impose it.

The hook also contains a commented-out **PR-only-main guard** (the `website-team-setup`
skill enables it when a team forms and the plan offers no server-side ruleset): enable it when several people
or parallel AI agents share the checkout and new commits should reach `main` only via reviewed
PRs (server-side branch protection needs a paid plan on private repos). It's a **local,
advisory convention, not an enforced one** — `ALLOW_MAIN_PUSH=1`, `git push --no-verify`, unsetting
`core.hooksPath`, or pushing from a different clone all bypass it — so it only helps when
everyone sharing the checkout has it enabled and respects it; it rejects direct pushes to
`main` (`ALLOW_MAIN_PUSH=1` overrides) from a checkout that has it on, while ship flows
pushing `main:production` and GitHub PR merges are unaffected either way.

## 4. Stop Claude asking permission for every command

**Claude Code only.** Copy the permission allowlist into the project so routine build
commands (npm/astro/playwright/git read+commit, image tools) run without a prompt:
```bash
mkdir -p .claude && cp "$SKILLS_ROOT/new-website/templates/claude/settings.json" .claude/settings.json
```
> **Codex / Antigravity:** skip this — `.claude/settings.json` is Claude Code-specific. On
> Codex, durable project instructions live in `AGENTS.md` (the scaffold ships one; `CLAUDE.md`
> imports it) and command approval in Codex's own rules/config. Antigravity uses its own
> sandbox/approval model.
It deliberately does **not** auto-allow destructive/irreversible commands (`rm -rf`,
`git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `wrangler … delete`, `gh repo delete`) — those still
ask. `git push` and `gh repo create` *are* allowed (own private repos, smooth workflow);
remove them from `allow` if you'd rather confirm each push.

`settings.json` is committed (shared project policy). Personal/secret overrides go in
`.claude/settings.local.json`, which the `.gitignore` keeps out of the repo. To extend the
list later, run `/fewer-permission-prompts`.
