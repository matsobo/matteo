# Regression guard for the push classifier in scripts/ship.sh.
#
# Nothing else exercises ship.sh — its only real workout is an actual publish, which
# is exactly why its failure messages were wrong three times before this existed. The
# worst of them: a transient `ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Operation timed
# out` was reported as "'production' has commits that 'main' doesn't have … Do NOT
# force-push", sending the owner hunting for a divergence that did not exist, when the
# right move was simply to run it again. Every scenario below is a failure someone
# actually hit, or one a review of the fix found hiding inside it.
#
# Divergence itself is now decided locally, before the network, by
# `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/production main` — deterministic, so it needs
# no test beyond "it blocks and never pushes". What is still prose-matching is the
# TRANSPORT half behind it, and that is exactly the kind of code that rots silently:
# an edited regex still runs, still exits, and only lies the next time a publish
# fails. This drives the real ship.sh with a stubbed `git` on PATH and
# asserts, per scenario, the exit code, how many pushes were attempted (the retry
# is only correct for connect-time failures) and which message the owner gets.
#
# The scratch cwd deliberately has no astro.config.mjs: that stops ship.sh right
# after the push, before it polls the live site, so the success cases stay offline.
