# Astro starter overlay (the `new-website` kit)

A complete, opinionated overlay you drop on top of a fresh Astro project: the SEO +
theme spine, the test suite, security headers, the preview-noindex function, and CI.
Copy-and-go for an Astro → GitHub → Cloudflare Pages site. The `new-website` skill
drives assembly; this README is the manual reference.

## What's here

```
package.json  tsconfig.json  astro.config.mjs  playwright.config.ts
.nvmrc                        # Node 22 — Astro needs >=22.12 (Cloudflare Pages reads it)

```
Sibling files in the parent `templates/`: `.gitignore`, `SETUP.md`,
`claude/settings.json` (permission allowlist), `content-guide.md`, `brand.md`.

## Bootstrap a new project

1. **Git first** (see SETUP.md): `mkdir <site> && cd <site> && git init`, copy the
   `templates/.gitignore`, commit.
2. `npm create astro@latest .` → Empty, TypeScript **Strict**. Requires **Node ≥22.12**
   (Astro's own floor); the committed `.nvmrc` pins 22 for local + Cloudflare Pages builds.
3. Copy this overlay over the scaffold (the files above) + `tests/`, then:
   ```bash
   npm i -D @playwright/test @axe-core/playwright @astrojs/check typescript @types/node
   npm i @astrojs/sitemap node-html-parser
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```
   (Or copy this `package.json` and run `npm install`.) **Commit the
   `package-lock.json`** — CI uses `npm ci`, which fails without it.
   On **npm ≥11.16**, `install` prints "packages have install scripts not yet covered"
   for scripts it hasn't been told to trust — per npm's own docs this is currently
   advisory only (the scripts still run; a future npm release will start blocking them),
   but approve the one Astro needs now to silence the warning and be ready ahead of that:
   `npm approve-scripts esbuild`. (sharp no longer has an install script — since 0.35 it
   ships prebuilt binaries, so it needs no approval.)
4. Set the real domain in `astro.config.mjs` (`site:`) and `src/config.ts`
   (`SITE.url`, name, theme color, analytics — and check `PROD_BRANCH` matches the
   branch Cloudflare Pages will call "Production", or analytics never loads).
   Add `public/` icons; edit the placeholder `manifest.webmanifest`. Set the BRAND
   block in `scripts/generate_og_cards.py` and run `npm run og` to regenerate the
   1200×630 share cards (`public/images/og/`; the starter ships a default).
   Fill the `[BRACKET]` slots in `src/pages/privacy.astro`
   (controller, date, analytics wording — see the comment block in that file).
5. `npm run check && npm run build && npm test` — the overlay passes strict TS +
   a11y/seo/navigation/anchors/orphans/images/tone/positioning/email/links/llms-coverage/middleware out of the box. Then build pages
   test-first (`<Base title="…" description="…">`).

> `links.spec.ts` is the **offline** guard: it only blocks domains you've already
> retired (its `STALE_DOMAINS` list, empty at start) from creeping back in — it makes
> no network calls, so it stays in CI. The **liveness** sweep of the links you keep
> (are they still 200? did one rebrand?) is network-dependent and lives in
> `scripts/check_external_links.sh` + the `outgoing-link-audit` skill — run monthly /
> pre-launch, never in CI.

> `orphans.spec.ts` is the **internal**-link counterpart: it fails if any page in
> `PAGES` is unreachable from the home page by following internal links (a page in the
> sitemap that nothing links to). It's offline and in CI. The richer report — inbound
> link COUNT per page, "thin" pages with a single nav-only link, "deep" pages >3 clicks
> from home, and WHERE to add the missing contextual links per the `site-architecture`
> internal-linking strategy — is `scripts/check_internal_links.sh` + the
> `internal-link-audit` skill. Deliberately-unlinked pages (a paid-ad landing page) go
> in `ORPHAN_EXEMPT` with a reason rather than loosening the test.

> `llms-coverage.spec.ts` keeps `public/llms.txt` (the curated GEO page map) in sync
> both ways: every route in `PAGES` must appear in it as a markdown link to its full
> production URL, and every same-site page link in it must map back to a `PAGES`
> route (no stale entry after a page is removed or renamed). The file is
> hand-maintained, so it drifts silently otherwise. Deliberately-hidden pages (a
> paid-ad landing page — llms.txt is public, listing one would expose it to AI
> engines) go in `LLMS_EXEMPT` with a reason. Whether an entry's *wording* still
> matches the page stays a `website-review` / `website-seo-geo` judgment item.

## Section anchors

`scripts/anchor-ids.mjs` runs as the second half of `npm run build`: it walks the
built `dist/` HTML and gives every `h2`/`h3` a short slug `id`, so any section is
linkable from an external site with no per-page work. The id is the heading's first
**two meaningful words** (filler words like "the/with/how" dropped), e.g. `<h2>The
outcomes we deliver</h2>` → `id="outcomes-deliver"`; a third word is appended only
to break a clash with another heading on the page, before falling back to a numeric
suffix. A hyphenated name or domain (e.g. `acme-corp`) counts as one word, keeping its
own hyphen. Change the word count via `ID_WORDS` at the top of the script. The ids are written into the **static** HTML (no runtime JS), so crawlers,
AI answer engines and the browser's on-load scroll all see them. `h1` is skipped —
one per page, so its fragment would just duplicate the page URL. `anchors.spec.ts`
proves every internal `#fragment` you write resolves to a real id.

Two kinds of heading are **left alone** (never auto-id'd), so a generated id can
never collide with or fragment a hand-curated one:
- a heading that already has an explicit `id` (`<h2 id="pricing">`) — curated wins;
- a heading inside a `<section>`/`<article>` that has an `id` — that wrapper is
  already the section's anchor (e.g. `<section id="pricing"><h2>…`).

Caveat for links you publish elsewhere: an auto-slug tracks the heading text, so
rewording the heading changes its id and breaks the old link. For any anchor you
hand out externally, **set an explicit `id`** (on the heading or its section) — it
wins over the auto-slug and never drifts.

Deploy: Cloudflare Pages, build `npm run build`, output `dist/`. In the Pages
project settings set the **production branch to `production`** (must equal
`PROD_BRANCH` in `src/config.ts`); `main` stays the preview (every preview
`*.pages.dev` host is noindexed by the function). Once the live domain serves the
site, set the Production variable `CANONICAL_URL` (e.g. `https://example.com`) and
redeploy: the project alias `<project>.pages.dev` then 301s to the live domain, so
people following an AI answer that cites the alias land on the real domain. Until then the alias is noindexed
like a preview. Steps, and how a site built before this change picks it up (new
middleware + redeploy): `new-website/references/CLOUDFLARE_FIRST_DEPLOY.md`, "After
go-live". AI assistant deploying or announcing a
deploy: read `PUBLISHING.md` § "For AI assistants — deploy-time guardrails"
first (preview-vs-live announcements + the cached-404 rule) — every time, not
just the first.
