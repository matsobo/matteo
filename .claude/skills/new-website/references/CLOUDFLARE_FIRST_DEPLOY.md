# First deploy to Cloudflare Pages — getting the site online the first time

`PUBLISHING.md` covers the **ongoing** `commit → push → rebuild` loop. This covers the
**one-time bootstrap**: creating the Cloudflare Pages project, the first deploy, and
(optionally) attaching the custom domain + turning on IndexNow. For someone who has never
touched Cloudflare, this is the hardest, most nerve-wracking part — so **offer to do it for
them** rather than handing over a dashboard tour.

> **Assistant: present the three options below and recommend (A) for anyone new to
> Cloudflare.** (B) and (C) are perfectly fine and stay on offer — they just cost the owner
> more time and patience. State the deploy-model tradeoff in (A) before they mint anything.

---

## A. Token-assisted bootstrap — RECOMMENDED for Cloudflare newcomers

The owner mints **one scoped, expiring API token**; you (the agent) run Wrangler to
create the project and deploy — **no dashboard for the deploy itself**. Two doc facts to
know (confirmed against current Cloudflare docs, June 2026):
- **Custom domain:** Wrangler has *no* Pages custom-domain command
  ([workers-sdk#11772](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/11772) is open),
  but the **Pages REST API can attach it with the same Pages-Edit token** — so the token
  *does* cover this, just not via the Wrangler CLI.
- **Crawler Hints / IndexNow:** [no API at all](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/how-do-i-enable-crawler-hints-through-the-api/384104) —
  it's the one dashboard toggle in `search-console-setup`, whatever deploy path you pick.

So this is the fastest path to "my site is live"; IndexNow is a short dashboard visit
afterwards (or the browser-assisted path in C).

**Tradeoff — state this up front:** this uses Wrangler's **direct-upload** deploy model.
Ongoing deploys are then `wrangler pages deploy`, **not** Cloudflare's git-push auto-build
that `PUBLISHING.md` assumes. A direct-upload project and a Git-connected project are
*different Pages project types* — pick (A) **or** (B), not both. If the owner wants
push-to-deploy afterwards, prefer (B). (A) is the right call when the priority is getting
live fast with zero dashboard time.

### The token — least-privilege, never the Global API Key

1. Dashboard → **My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → Create Custom Token**.
2. **Permissions** — add only what the chosen steps need:
   - **Account › Cloudflare Pages › Edit** (a.k.a. `Pages Write`) — create the project,
     deploy, **and** attach a custom domain via the Pages REST API
     (`POST /accounts/{id}/pages/projects/{name}/domains`). *(required — and it's all the
     happy path needs.)*
   - **Zone › DNS › Edit**, scoped to the **one** zone — **only** if the flow also creates
     or changes DNS records itself. Attaching the custom domain does **not** need this on
     its own; skip it unless you're scripting DNS. *(optional)*
   - *(There is no Crawler Hints permission — it has no API. Enable IndexNow via the single
     dashboard toggle in `search-console-setup`, whichever deploy path you pick.)*
3. **Account Resources:** include only the owner's account. **Zone Resources:** only the
   one target zone (never "All zones").
4. **Expiry:** set an **End date ~1 week out** — enough to bootstrap, then it dies on its own.
5. Create → copy the token (**shown once**).

### Hand it to the agent safely — never the repo

- Provide it as a session env var: `export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=…` (Wrangler reads this),
  or a gitignored `.dev.vars` (also Wrangler-recognised). The starter `.gitignore` excludes
  `.env*` and `.dev.vars`, so it's the **primary** leak protection in a generated site.
  *(This suite repo additionally runs a `clean` CI gate that scans the distributed skill
  package for stray tokens — that gate does **not** run in generated sites.)*
- **Never** commit it, paste it into a tracked file, or put it in the README.

### Assistant guardrails (non-negotiable)

1. **Scoped token only.** If the owner offers a Global API Key or their password, decline
   and ask for a custom token with the permissions above.
2. **Expiring + minimal.** Confirm the token has an end date and only the needed scopes
   before using it; if it looks over-scoped (e.g. "All zones"), say so and ask them to narrow it.
3. **Never commit the credential** — env var or gitignored `.dev.vars` only; the starter
   `.gitignore` is the backstop.
4. **Confirm before each account-modifying command** — state what it will do (create project
   `X`, deploy, add a DNS record for `Y`) and run it only on the owner's go-ahead.
5. **Revoke when done** — once the site is live, tell the owner to delete the token
   (My Profile → API Tokens → ⋯ → Delete), or let the expiry retire it. Don't leave a live
   token lying around. And never drive these changes through blind screen control.
6. **The deploy-time guardrails apply from this very first deploy** — the preview-vs-live
   announcements and the cached-404 rule in `templates/PUBLISHING.md` § "For AI
   assistants — deploy-time guardrails" (see the pointer in SKILL.md §4). The first
   request a brand-new custom domain sees is the one the edge caches.

### Commands you run (token in env)

```bash
# 1. Create the Pages project (direct-upload).
npx wrangler pages project create <project> --production-branch <main|production>

# 2. Build, then deploy the static output. --branch = the production branch from step 1;
#    without it wrangler uses the local git branch and may make a preview deployment.
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name <project> --branch <main|production>

# 3. Custom domain: NO Wrangler command exists for Pages custom domains.
#    Attach it in the dashboard (Workers & Pages -> your project -> Custom domains ->
#    Set up a domain), OR via the Pages REST API with the SAME Pages-Edit token:
#    POST /accounts/{id}/pages/projects/{project}/domains  {"name":"<domain>"}
#    (Zone>DNS>Edit is only needed if you also script the DNS record itself.)
```

> **`pages deploy`, not plain `deploy` — or you get a `workers.dev` URL.** These are static
> **Pages** sites: every command above is `wrangler pages …` and the deploy must print a
> **`<project>.pages.dev`** URL. A bare `wrangler deploy` (no `pages`) publishes a **Worker**
> and hands back a `*.workers.dev` URL instead — a real mistake we've seen on an older kit
> version. If you see `workers.dev`, stop: you deployed the wrong project type. Confirm it's
> the accidental Worker (not a pre-existing one with a similar name), then delete it and
> re-run `wrangler pages deploy`.

Ongoing deploys under (A): re-run
`wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name <project> --branch <production-branch>`
(wrap it in `npm run ship` if you want one command — note the stock `ship.sh` targets the
git-push model of (B), so adapting it for direct-upload is a follow-up, not assumed here).
Then continue with `search-console-setup` for GSC/Bing + Crawler Hints.

## B. GitHub git-integration — RECOMMENDED if the owner wants push-to-deploy and no token

One-time guided dashboard connect, then `git push` builds automatically — the model
`PUBLISHING.md` assumes. No token, but the owner does the one-time OAuth connect:

Cloudflare → **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git** → pick the repo →
framework preset **Astro**, build command `npm run build`, output directory `dist`. For a
two-stage site, choose **Production branch = `production`** in this same form (see
new-website §4): connecting builds and publishes the production branch straight away, so
leaving it at `main` would publish the preview first.

## C. Browser-assisted or manual walk-through — the fallback

If the owner won't mint a token and won't do the dashboard alone: drive the dashboard via
your runtime's browser automation (**Claude in Chrome** under Claude Code; the agent's own
browser tool otherwise — see `search-console-setup`), or read them the clicks one by one.
Both work; both eat time and patience — which is why **(A) is recommended for true newcomers**.

## Going live: moving an existing domain's DNS to Cloudflare — verify twice

When the site replaces a domain that already serves mail and a live site elsewhere (a
rebuild migrating its DNS to Cloudflare), the cutover is the **single riskiest moment** — a
wrong or wrongly-proxied record silently breaks email or the site right when it goes live.
Treat it as a checklist *with* the owner, never a fire-and-forget edit:

1. **Import, then check every record twice.** When Cloudflare scans the existing zone it
   often misses records. Compare the imported set against the old DNS provider's export
   **entry by entry, twice** — A/AAAA, CNAME, **all MX**, and every TXT (SPF, DKIM, DMARC,
   verification tokens). A missing MX or SPF record = broken mail. The scan is least reliable
   on **CNAME, SRV, and CAA** records even when A/MX/TXT come through, so confirm those by
   hand:
   - **Microsoft 365 / Outlook:** verify `autodiscover` (CNAME → `autodiscover.outlook.com`),
     the DKIM selector CNAMEs (`selector1._domainkey`, `selector2._domainkey`), and the
     Teams/Skype SRV records (`_sip._tls`, `_sipfederationtls._tcp`). A missing `autodiscover`
     has been seen on a real migration (Cloudflare may have since improved this — **verify, don't
     assume**); without it Outlook mailbox auto-setup breaks.
   - **CAA** records — two failure modes: if existing CAA records are *dropped*, or if they
     are *restrictive and don't list Cloudflare's CA*, Cloudflare can't issue the TLS cert
     for the domain (including the Pages custom domain). If any CAA records exist, **confirm
     they permit Cloudflare's CAs before go-live.**
   - **Wildcard (`*`)** records and **subdomain NS delegations** — both commonly skipped.
2. **Get a screenshot and double-check it.** Have the owner screenshot the final Cloudflare
   DNS table and pass it back so you can review it against the old zone before they flip the
   nameservers. A second pair of eyes catches the record that was dropped or mistyped.
3. **Know which records must NOT be proxied (grey cloud, DNS-only).** Cloudflare's orange
   "proxy" cloud only makes sense for the **HTTP(S) hosts you actually serve through
   Cloudflare** (usually apex + `www` for this kit; proxy any other host only if it
   intentionally serves HTTP through Cloudflare). Everything else must stay **DNS-only**, or
   it breaks:
   - **MX records and the mail hostnames they point to** — proxying mail destroys delivery.
   - **SPF / DKIM / DMARC** and other **TXT** records (they aren't HTTP; proxy doesn't apply).
   - **CNAMEs that aren't your website** — the sneaky trap, because only A/AAAA/CNAME records
     *can* be proxied and onboarding often defaults the proxy **ON**: `autodiscover` /
     `autoconfig`, **DKIM selector CNAMEs**, domain-**verification** CNAMEs, and third-party
     service CNAMEs (email, helpdesk, status pages). A stray orange cloud on any of these
     breaks the service — leave them DNS-only.
   - Any record that must resolve to its **real origin IP** (e.g. a service expecting the
     true address, not Cloudflare's edge).
   Make sure the owner *understands* this distinction — don't just set it silently.
4. **Disable DNSSEC at the registrar before touching nameservers.** Check whether DNSSEC is
   enabled at the old provider/registrar; if it is, **turn it off first** (or follow
   Cloudflare's DNSSEC migration path). Flipping nameservers while the old DS record is still
   live leaves a signature chain Cloudflare can't satisfy — resolvers then return
   `SERVFAIL` and the domain goes dark. Re-enable DNSSEC in Cloudflare afterwards if wanted.
5. **Only after the passes agree and DNSSEC is handled**, change the nameservers / flip the
   apex. Then confirm the site loads on the live domain **and** send a test email both
   directions.

> **Pages: attach the custom domain in the project — a DNS record alone isn't enough.** For a
> Pages site, just adding a CNAME/record that points at `<project>.pages.dev` does **not**
> connect the domain; the domain must be added through the Pages **Custom domains** flow
> (dashboard, or the REST API in §A) or visitors get a **522**. And once it's attached, don't
> "test" by pointing the record away from Pages and back — Cloudflare can serve errors until
> it reactivates; use a redirect/origin rule for any temporary routing instead.

> **Make rollback cheap — and don't tear the old setup down yet.** Lower the record TTLs at
> the old provider ~24h *before* the move. After the flip, **keep the old zone, site, and mail
> running through the propagation window** — resolvers may serve cached DNS for a while, so you
> want an instant fall-back. Only retire the old setup once the new domain is confirmed
> resolving and mail flows both directions.

> Drive these changes *with* the owner, not through blind screen control — same guardrail as
> the bootstrap token steps above.

## After go-live: send `<project>.pages.dev` to the live domain

Every Pages project also serves production at its own alias, `<project>.pages.dev`. The
kit's `functions/_middleware.ts` noindexes it, but that does not keep it out of AI
answers: AI search engines have been seen citing the alias instead of the real domain. So
once the site is live, the alias should 301-redirect to the live domain: anyone who
follows such a link lands on the real site, and crawlers are told which host counts. It
won't rewrite an answer an AI engine has already given; re-check citations after a few
weeks.

The redirect is **off until you switch it on**, because before launch the alias may be the
only address that works. Switch it on only when the live domain really serves this site —
custom domain **Active**, DNS flipped, and `https://<live-domain>/build.txt?cb=<something new>`
showing the current build:

1. Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages** → the project → **Settings → Variables and
   Secrets** → **Production** → add a plain-text variable `CANONICAL_URL` =
   `https://example.com` (the live origin, same as `SITE.url`; no path, no trailing slash).
   Production only: previews must keep working, and the middleware never redirects a
   preview host anyway. Open `<that value>/build.txt?cb=<something new>` (e.g.
   `https://example.com/build.txt?cb=2609261430`) before saving and confirm it
   shows the current build: browsers remember a 301, so a typo'd domain keeps sending
   visitors to the wrong place even after you correct the variable.
2. **Redeploy with a new commit.** A variable only reaches deployments made after it was
   set, so the redirect starts with the site's next ordinary publish. To switch it on now,
   note that `npm run ship` or a push with nothing new to publish does **not** redeploy —
   git says "Everything up-to-date", Cloudflare builds nothing, and ship's "✓ LIVE" check
   still passes on the old build. Make an empty commit
   (`git commit --allow-empty -m "Apply CANONICAL_URL"`) and bring it onto `main` the way
   this site takes changes (`AGENTS.md` §2: an assistant opens a pull request; the owner
   may push directly unless the site is pull-request-only), then run `npm run ship`
   (two-stage); on a single-stage site reaching `main` is the publish. Direct-upload sites
   (§A): re-run `npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name <project> --branch
   <production-branch>` — without `--branch`, wrangler may take the local git branch
   (`main`) and make a preview deployment instead.
3. Check: `curl -sI https://<project>.pages.dev/about` answers `301` with
   `location: https://example.com/about`, and a preview host still answers `200` with
   `x-robots-tag: noindex, nofollow` — two-stage: `main.<project>.pages.dev`; single-stage:
   any `<hash>.<project>.pages.dev` from `npx wrangler pages deployment list`. Still `200`
   on the alias? The variable isn't under **Production** (missing, misnamed, or added to
   Preview), the deployment predates it (step 2), the value was rejected (not `https://`,
   a `pages.dev` host, or a malformed host such as `example..com` — check it by eye), or
   the site's `functions/_middleware.ts` predates the redirect (below).

A value the middleware can't use (not `https://`, a `pages.dev` host, or a malformed host)
is ignored and logged, so the alias stays noindexed rather than breaking. A well-formed but
wrong domain is not caught: it redirects there, which is why step 1 checks the value first.

**Sites scaffolded before this redirect existed** need the new `functions/_middleware.ts`
first: copy it from `templates/astro/functions/_middleware.ts`
(`make whats-new PROJECT=<site-dir>` lists it when it changed) and commit it, but don't
push until step 1 is saved: on a single-stage site that push is the production deploy.
Then do steps 1–3; that commit is the new commit step 2 needs. Nothing changes on a live site until that
redeploy.

After the switch, the alias no longer shows the latest production build. To check a build
went Active, use `wrangler pages deployment list` or the deployment's hash URL
(`<hash>.<project>.pages.dev`), never the live domain (see `PUBLISHING.md`).
