# Setting up a reviewer — full detail

The onboarding wizard in `SKILL.md` points here for the install commands, the
full tool comparison, and the ollama model/RAM tables. This file is reference
material for the agent to pull from during the wizard — it is not meant to be
dumped on the user wholesale.

**Freshness warning:** pricing, free-tier quotas, and exact install commands
for all three tools change often (Codex CLI's pricing model itself changed
once already in 2026, message-based → token/credit-based). Nothing below
should be presented to the user as a permanent guarantee — see "Verify before
quoting a number" at the bottom.

## The three options, compared

| | Codex CLI (OpenAI) | Antigravity / `agy` (Google) | ollama (local) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Account needed** | Free ChatGPT account | Free personal Gmail account | None |
| **Cost** | Free tier, paid plans from $20/mo | Free tier, paid plans from $20/mo | $0, always |
| **Setup effort (non-technical)** | ~10–20 min; one terminal command + browser sign-in | ~10–20 min; IDE is a plain installer, but the `agy` CLI (what this skill actually uses) needs a separate terminal command | ~10–20 min install + a model download (minutes to tens of minutes depending on connection and model size) |
| **Needs a terminal at all?** | Yes, once, to install | Yes, once, to install `agy` (the IDE alone is terminal-free, but doesn't power this skill) | Yes, once, to install and pull a model |
| **Review quality** | Sharp, frontier-class | Sharp, frontier-class (Gemini family) | Noticeably weaker unless the machine can run a large (20B+) model — see below |
| **Usage limits on free tier** | Rolling window, resets in hours; exact numbers are not reliably published and vary by plan/model — see caveat below | "Basic weekly rate limits," no published number; **one dated real-world report (XDA Developers, May 12 2026) describes a lockout of up to ~7 days after as little as 20–30 minutes of use** — the free tier is tight and its limits are opaque by design; see caveat below | None — fully unlimited, runs entirely on your own machine |
| **Privacy** | Diff/plan text leaves your machine to OpenAI | Diff/plan text leaves your machine to Google | Nothing leaves your machine |
| **What happens when you hit the limit** | Current task finishes; new tasks pause until the window resets, or upgrade, or (if configured) pay per token via an API key | Locked out until the weekly reset — no pay-as-you-go on the free tier itself (that requires upgrading to Pro/Ultra) | N/A — never happens |

**Recommendation to give a non-technical user who asks "which one?" (assumes
the AI assistant running this guide is Claude Code — the common case; if the
assistant IS Codex or Antigravity/Gemini itself, that tool is same-family
with itself and doesn't satisfy the skill's cross-model gate, so swap the
recommendation to whichever cloud tool is genuinely a different model
family — see SKILL.md's Independence rule):**
Set up Codex CLI first (most predictable free tier of the two cloud options,
least surprising). Set up ollama alongside it as a free, unlimited backup —
it's the fallback for whenever Codex's limit is hit, or for a totally private
review with nothing leaving the machine. Antigravity is worth adding too if
they're comfortable with the tighter/less predictable free tier and want a
third, genuinely independent model family in the mix — the skill's own
design values having more than one cross-model reviewer.

## Install commands per tool

### Codex CLI

- **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install --cask codex`
- **macOS/Linux (no Homebrew):** `curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh`
- **Windows (PowerShell):** `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex"`
- **Any OS with Node.js already installed:** `npm install -g @openai/codex`

First run: type `codex` in a terminal → it prompts to authenticate → choose
"Sign in with ChatGPT" (opens a browser, one click to approve).

**Gotchas:**
- Fresh Mac, first-ever `brew` command: macOS may prompt to install Xcode
  Command Line Tools first (a separate few-minute download) — normal, let it
  finish, then re-run the `brew install` command.
- The `npm install -g` path needs Node.js already on the machine — if
  `npm: command not found`, install Node.js first (nodejs.org, the LTS
  installer) or use one of the other install paths instead.
- After install, if `codex: command not found` in a *new* terminal window,
  the install path isn't on `PATH` — closing and reopening the terminal
  usually fixes it; if not, this is a "🧑 hand-off to a human with more
  terminal experience" situation, not something to keep guessing at.

### Antigravity IDE + `agy` CLI

These are **two separate installs** that happen to share a login. The IDE is
a normal point-and-click app; `agy` is what this skill's automated reviews
actually use, and it needs a terminal command to install.

- **IDE (optional — only needed if the user also wants to use Antigravity
  themselves interactively):** download the installer from
  antigravity.google/download (macOS `.dmg`, Windows `.exe`, Linux `.tar.gz`)
  and install like any normal app. macOS with Homebrew:
  `brew install --cask antigravity-ide`.
- **`agy` CLI (this is the one the skill needs):**
  - macOS/Linux: `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash`
  - Windows PowerShell: `irm https://antigravity.google/cli/install.ps1 | iex`
  - macOS with Homebrew: `brew install --cask antigravity-cli`

First run: `agy` prompts a Google sign-in (personal Gmail account, no
Workspace/corporate account needed — those go through a separate enterprise
path and aren't relevant here). `agy models` afterward lists available
models and confirms the login worked.

**Gotchas:**
- Don't confuse "I installed the Antigravity IDE" with "the skill can use
  Antigravity" — they're separate installs. Only `agy` on `PATH` and signed
  in makes the skill's automated review work.
- The free tier's weekly limit is opaque (Google doesn't publish an exact
  number) and real-world reports describe getting locked out after quite
  light use. Tell the user this plainly *before* they rely on it for
  anything time-sensitive — see the comparison table above.
- `agy --help` run with no arguments outside a script context can launch the
  full Antigravity GUI app instead of printing help text — don't probe it
  curiously; use `agy models` to check the install/login instead.

### ollama (local, no account)

- **macOS:** download the `.dmg` from ollama.com/download, open it, drag the
  app to Applications. (Or `brew install ollama`.)
- **Windows:** download and run the `.exe` installer from ollama.com/download
  — installs and starts like any normal Windows app.
- **Linux:** `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`

After install, model download and every future run happens from a terminal
(`ollama pull <model>`, `ollama run <model>`) regardless of OS — there's no
avoiding the terminal for this step, unlike the IDE-only Antigravity path.

## Picking a model — RAM decides this, don't guess

**Check installed RAM first, then pick from the table — don't let the user
guess or default to the biggest model "to be safe."** A model that doesn't
fit in RAM either fails to load or runs so slowly it's unusable. The table
below is keyed to *installed* RAM, not RAM free at this exact moment — if the
machine is already under heavy memory pressure from other apps, the honest
move is telling the user to close them first, not silently dropping a tier.

**Check the machine:**
- macOS: `sysctl hw.memsize` (answer is in bytes — divide by 1,073,741,824
  for GB), or Apple menu → About This Mac.
- Windows: Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) → Performance tab → Memory; the same
  tab's GPU entry shows dedicated VRAM if there's a discrete GPU. Or
  `systeminfo` in Command Prompt → "Total Physical Memory."
- Linux: `free -h` for RAM; `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA GPU) or `lspci | grep -i vga`
  to check for a discrete GPU.

Apple Silicon Macs (M1–M4) use unified memory — there's no separate VRAM
number to check; the figure from `sysctl hw.memsize` is the whole budget.

**RAM → model table** (dated examples for the LOCAL sanity tier only — the
review pipeline itself is model-agnostic and hardcodes none of them; sizes are each tag's default-pull download size, not
a uniform quantization scheme — ollama's per-tag default varies (e.g.
`gpt-oss` ships natively in MXFP4, `deepseek-coder-v2:16b` defaults to
Q4_0); run `ollama show <tag>` if the exact quantization matters for your
case, don't assume Q4_K_M applies to every row. Sized to leave headroom for
the OS — each row's model is meaningfully smaller than the RAM tier it's
keyed to, on purpose. One default tag per row — recommend exactly that one;
mention a row's noted exception only when the user explicitly accepts its
stated constraints, never as an unprompted choice to pick between):

| Installed RAM | Pull this | Size | What it's realistically good for |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 GB | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | 4.7 GB | Surface-level bugs: obvious null-check gaps, off-by-ones, inverted conditionals. Close other apps first — it's tight. |
| 16 GB | `deepseek-coder-v2:16b` | 8.9 GB | Noticeably better context-holding than 7B; still not adversarial-grade. (`gpt-oss:20b`, 14 GB, is sharper but leaves only ~2 GB for the OS and everything else — don't recommend it as the default; mention it only if the user says they'll close every other app first.) |
| 32 GB | `qwen3-coder:30b` | ~19 GB | The best currently-realistic local option — meaningfully narrows the gap to cloud models, though still a notch below Codex/Antigravity on subtle, multi-file, or business-logic bugs. |
| 64–95 GB | `llama3.3:70b` | ~43 GB | Diminishing returns vs. 30B for most review purposes; only worth it if the RAM is already sitting there unused. |
| 96 GB+ | `gpt-oss:120b` | 65 GB | Same diminishing-returns caveat as `llama3.3:70b` — a 65 GB model needs real headroom above it, which is why it's a separate tier rather than folded into the 64 GB row (a 64 GB machine can't fit it at all). |

Tags and sizes above were spot-checked at the time of writing; ollama library
retags occasionally change a tag's underlying quantization or default
variant. If a pull comes back a meaningfully different size than the table
says, trust `ollama list`'s actual reported size over this table and recheck
against RAM before proceeding — don't assume the table is still current.

(`qwen3-coder:30b` and `gpt-oss:20b` are mixture-of-experts models — despite
the "30B"/"20B" name, they only load their active-expert weights, which is
why their RAM footprint tracks the download size, not the full parameter
count. This is why a "30B" model fits in ~20 GB.)

**Be honest about the ceiling.** Even the best model that fits on a normal
laptop (`qwen3-coder:30b`) still lags frontier cloud models (Codex,
Antigravity/Gemini, Claude) on subtle, multi-file, or business-logic-context
bugs, and is more prone to confidently-wrong explanations. Per the skill's
own reviewer-tier rules, ollama **never satisfies the review gate alone** —
it's a free, always-available sanity pass and a backup when the cloud
options are unavailable or rate-limited, not a standing replacement for them.
Say this to the user directly; don't let "it's free and unlimited" imply
"it's just as good."

**Legacy models to skip:** `codellama` (Meta, 2023) is superseded by
`qwen2.5-coder`/`deepseek-coder-v2`/`qwen3-coder` on essentially every coding
benchmark — don't recommend it as a first choice. `granite-code` (IBM) is a
reasonable niche pick only for legacy enterprise languages (COBOL, older
Java) — not a general recommendation.

## Getting a Claude/Anthropic reviewer on a non-Claude host

When the assistant running this skill is itself Codex or Antigravity/Gemini, SKILL.md's
Independence rule already lists cross-model options that don't require Claude at all — e.g. on a
Codex host, ollama-cloud or Gemini both satisfy the gate alone. Claude is an *additional* option,
not a requirement: useful when you specifically want a third, distinct model family in the mix,
or when the other options are unavailable or rate-limited. The Antigravity CLI (`agy`) can reach one —
set `AGY_MODEL` to a Claude model from `agy models` and the script runs
`agy --sandbox --mode plan --model "<that model>" -p "<review prompt>"` (`run_agy` in
`scripts/independent_review.sh`), via the same free Antigravity/Gemini login used for the Gemini
seat elsewhere in this guide. Onboarding's model-confirmation step (Step 5 at this writing) covers
checking which model actually ran.
Confirm the model family from the run's own output, per that same step's rule — the confirmed
family, not an assumed default, is what satisfies the gate. The older `agy --sandbox -p` form worked
headless on 2026-07-02 but returned nothing on 2026-09-26 (a tool call auto-denied), which is why
`--mode plan` and a text-only prompt were added. On 2026-09-27 a plan-mode run still came back
empty: the prompt said "You have NO tools", the model tried `echo` to test that, and the refusal
ended the run. agy now gets its own prompt, which drops that claim, asks for no tool calls, and
says a call can lose the review. Neither change makes an empty run impossible: re-verify before
relying on it.

This is **not** a separate free lane — it's the same `agy` CLI and the same scarce-quota,
opt-in-only rule as every other Antigravity use in this skill (see SKILL.md's reviewer stack).
Claude Code itself has no free tier (Pro/API only); the free claude.ai paste tier (tier 6, manual
paste) fits a plan or a small diff at best.

## Verify before quoting a number

Two things researched for this guide are explicitly **unstable and likely to
drift**:

1. **Codex CLI's exact free-tier usage numbers.** Independent sources gave
   inconsistent ranges for "messages per 5-hour window" depending on plan and
   model, and OpenAI's own canonical pricing page could not be fetched
   directly during this research (blocked). Don't state a specific number to
   a user — point them at OpenAI's current pricing page
   ([chatgpt.com/codex/pricing](https://chatgpt.com/codex/pricing)) if they
   want exact figures, and describe the shape qualitatively instead ("a
   rolling several-hour window, resets automatically, current task finishes
   even if you hit it mid-task").
2. **Antigravity's exact free-tier quota.** Google has deliberately not
   published a number ("basic weekly rate limits" is the entire official
   description as of this writing). The one concrete data point available is
   a single dated report — XDA Developers, May 12 2026, ["I tried Google's
   Antigravity for a week, and this limitation made me close it for
   good"](https://www.xda-developers.com/tried-googles-antigravity-limitation-made-close-it-good/)
   — describing a real-world lockout of up to ~7 days after roughly 20–30
   minutes of active use. Cite it as exactly that (one reviewer's dated
   account, not an
   official guarantee), not as a hard fact about what every user will
   experience — and don't drop the citation when quoting the number; the
   number without its source is exactly the kind of stale-prone claim this
   caveat exists to prevent.

If either tool's pricing page is reachable when this guide is next revisited,
re-verify and update this file rather than propagating stale numbers forward.
