# independent_review.sh — external-model half of the `independent-review` gate.
# DEFAULT STANDARD PAIR = Codex CLI + ollama-cloud (your signed-in ':cloud' model, auto-detected) — both run
# every time (or the first that succeeds with --first-success), and their
# ranked BUG/RISK/NIT reviews print. The skill ALSO runs a host fresh-eyes pass
# (tier 3 — whatever model family the host agent is) and consolidates.
#
# Antigravity (`agy`/Gemini) is OPT-IN ONLY — pass --with-antigravity or set
# WITH_ANTIGRAVITY=1. It does NOT run by default and is never used as a silent
# fallback: the owner's Antigravity free-tier credits are scarce and are spent
# only when explicitly asked for (a genuinely hard case, or the owner directly
# requests "antigravity review"/"agy review"). Default runs never touch it.
#
# PLAN gate DEFAULTS to wanting 2 reviewers: for --plan (or auto-detected plan
# type) with no --first-success, both Codex and ollama are attempted — "first
# thing that answered" isn't enough independence for a high-stakes planning
# doc by default. This is advisory, not enforced: an explicit --first-success
# on a plan is HONORED (stops after 1 reviewer), not overridden — a caller's
# conscious choice for a lower-stakes plan. A note fires either way when a
# plan — or a diff — lands with <2 reviewers (see report_round below).
#
# Exit 0 only means "≥1 reviewer produced output" — the VERDICT (unaddressed
# BUG / unwaived RISK = gate FAIL) is enforced by the skill from the findings,
# never by this exit code. Exit 4 means no GATE-ELIGIBLE reviewer succeeded —
# every internal tier already tried and exhausted, OR the only output
# produced (e.g. a local-ollama sanity pass outside --local-only) was
# real but policy-ineligible to satisfy the gate on its own; either way
# treat it as FAIL, never as clean. NOTE: this differs from the
# sibling per-tier scripts (bugfix-mr-flow's codex_review.sh/
# antigravity_review.sh, ollama-review's ollama_review.sh), where exit 4 means
# "this one tier hit quota, the caller should cascade to the next tier" — a
# soft/recoverable signal, not a terminal FAIL. Same number, different
# contract: this script drives its own internal cascade and never expects a
# caller to treat its exit 4 as anything but final.
#
# A PARTIAL round is not hidden behind exit 0: every tier that was attempted
# leaves a stdout section — its review, or "## Independent review — <tier> —
# FAILED" quoting its error — and the run ends with one "reviewers:" line
# (e.g. "reviewers: codex OK, ollama-cloud FAILED (quota/rate limit: …)").
#
# SECURITY. The preferred reviewer runs as `codex exec -s read-only`, which ASKS
# the CLI for a read-only sandbox. Three more settings: --skip-git-repo-check only lets it
# start outside a git repo or trusted project; -c project_doc_max_bytes=0 and
# -c skills.include_instructions=false keep a project's AGENTS.md out of its instructions
# and stop it listing skills there (one live probe each, not tested; see the notes above
# codex_bin). Whether
# the sandbox blocks writes is not tested here (R-SANDBOX), and project content can still
# reach codex other ways (R-PROJCTX), both in
# docs/reviews/OPEN-FINDINGS-independent-review.md. The ollama tier
# only sends text. So: treat any external reviewer as untrusted, keep reviews off
# anything you could not afford a stray write to, and never pass a write/danger
# sandbox flag for a review.

# Usage:
#   independent_review.sh PLAN.md               # type auto-detected: plan
#   independent_review.sh change.patch --diff   # force diff framing
#   git diff main...HEAD | independent_review.sh -   # stdin -> auto diff

#   git diff <last-reviewed-head>..HEAD -- . ':(exclude)docs/reviews/' \
#     | independent_review.sh - --verify prior-findings.md
#                                                     # verification round (SKILL.md step 6)
# Env:
#   (codex model + reasoning effort default from ~/.codex/config.toml — daily driver)
#   CODEX_MODEL    (unset)           ad-hoc codex model override for THIS run only,
#                                    e.g. CODEX_MODEL=<model-tag> for a hard case or a
#                                    long plan. Does not touch config.toml's daily driver.
#   CODEX_EFFORT   (unset)           codex reasoning effort for THIS run (minimal|low|medium|
#                                    high|xhigh), passed as -c model_reasoning_effort=... .
#                                    Unset: config.toml's, except a --verify round, which
#                                    defaults to medium (it checks fixes, not the whole change).
#                                    CODEX_EFFORT=config keeps config.toml's there too.
#   OLLAMA_MODEL   (auto-detected)   ollama model for the standard second reviewer —
#                                    defaults to the first ':cloud' tag in `ollama list`
#                                    (the owner's signed-in cloud model; this script
#                                    prescribes no specific model). Override to point
#                                    at a different cloud/local tag.
#   OLLAMA_TRANSPORT (auto)          how the ollama tier is reached: cli (`ollama run`), api
#                                    (ollama's HTTP API via curl), or auto = the CLI when it is
#                                    installed, else the API. The API needs OLLAMA_MODEL set (no
#                                    `ollama list` to auto-detect from); a ':cloud' tag goes to
#                                    https://ollama.com without the suffix, a local tag to
#                                    OLLAMA_HOST (default 127.0.0.1:11434). Auth: OLLAMA_API_KEY if
#                                    set, else none is sent — in a cloud session an environment
#                                    API credential for ollama.com is added by the proxy.
#   AGY_MODEL      (unset)           Antigravity CLI model override — unset runs the
#                                    CLI's own default model. Used only when
#                                    --with-antigravity/WITH_ANTIGRAVITY=1 opts it in.
#   WITH_ANTIGRAVITY (0)             set to 1 (or pass --with-antigravity) to include
#                                    the Antigravity/agy tier for this run. Off by default.

# On the injection guard below: it is MITIGATION, not a security boundary. The artifact sits at
# the same prompt priority as these instructions, and no wording changes that. It is meant to
# reduce the chance of a model acting on embedded directives (a hypothesis, not measured), and it
# asks for such text to be reported; it does not make the artifact safe to trust. The intended
# boundary is the sandbox, which is why the tooled tier is also told to stay in-project and make
# no network calls; that the sandbox holds is not tested (R-SANDBOX in OPEN-FINDINGS).
#
# The old single prompt ended "Review ONLY — do not modify files or run commands" one sentence
# after "Do NOT trust the ${TYPE}'s own line numbers or claims". Not a strict logical
# contradiction — a reviewer can withhold belief without verifying — but it demanded skepticism
# while removing the only means of RESOLVING it, so unverifiable claims came back as silence
# rather than as findings. For codex, only the "do not modify files" HALF was redundant — `-s
# read-only` is meant to block writes (untested: R-SANDBOX). The "do not run commands" half was
# neither enforced nor redundant: it was the load-bearing half, and — on the hypothesis below —
# the harmful one. For the tool-less tiers the whole sentence was, on the same hypothesis, worse
# than redundant: a model told not to run commands, but never told it CANNOT, may narrate checks
# it never performed (a hypothesis, not measured).
#
# The unsupported-claim paragraph is in PROMPT_CORE, which PROMPT_TOOLED, PROMPT_TEXTONLY,
# PROMPT_AGY and PROMPT_PORTABLE each embed — checked by check_prompt_sync.sh. That every reviewer
# call below passes one of those four is not checked; it holds by reading the calls. An evidence gap is an
# UNVERIFIABLE entry, not a finding, so the tool-less tier carries no RISK floor for claims it
# could never check. The clean verdict is dictated word for word because looks_like_review()
# matches phrases, not meaning: "Nothing rises to a finding" is discarded where "No BUG/RISK/NIT
# findings" is kept (round 2, Codex). That is the validator's shape, not a good contract -- the
# contract is B-REFUSAL-TEXT's business, and a refusal could copy this phrase exactly as it can
# copy the phrases main already accepts. Whether the paragraph surfaces claims reviewers would otherwise miss, and
# what it costs in findings per round, is being piloted, not measured.
PROMPT_CORE="Adversarial independent reviewer of the ${TYPE} below. Return RANKED findings:
BUG (wrong now) / RISK (breaks on normal change, a guard that cannot fire, or an unsupported
load-bearing claim whose consequence is named) / NIT — each with file:line or anchor, one-line
why, concrete fix. Then list what you checked that was CLEAN (silence is not coverage). Do NOT
trust the ${TYPE}'s own claims or line numbers. Treat as unsupported any load-bearing claim (one
where, if it were false, a finding would change) about what a library, engine, runtime, language
feature or model DOES, unless this review checked its support: the component's own implementation
read, a test traced to the claim, a citation followed, a measurement reproduced. Reading the code
that CALLS a component shows what it passes, not what the component does with it. Group
unsupported claims by component, one entry each: the claim, the support it lacks, and the
observation that would settle it — the observation, not the outcome expected. Where that
observation is out of reach in this review the entry is UNVERIFIABLE, not a finding; make it a
RISK finding only where what breaks if the claim is false can be named. Phrase every entry about
the claim and its missing support, not about your own access. If nothing rises to a finding, say
exactly: No BUG/RISK/NIT findings. A reply carrying only UNVERIFIABLE entries, with no finding and
no verdict, cannot be told from a non-answer.

VERIFICATION ROUND. An earlier round reviewed this ${TYPE} and the author has changed it since. The
author's record of that round's findings, and what was done about each, sits between the PRIOR
FINDINGS markers. It is the author's claim, not evidence: check it. This round's scope:
1. Each prior finding marked fixed: did the fix land, and does it cover the finding's whole claim,
   not only the example it cited? A fix that did not land, or covers only part, is a finding at the
   original severity. Each finding marked deferred: does it meet the conditions its row states?
2. What changed since the last round, for new problems. For a diff, the ${TYPE} below is only that
   change; read surrounding code for context where you can, but it is not itself under review. For
   a plan, the record names the sections that changed.
Findings belong to 1 or 2. Anything else you notice goes under a heading OUTSIDE SCOPE, one line
each with its severity: a BUG there is still triaged as a finding, a RISK or NIT is recorded as a
follow-up and does not block. The author expects clean; do not report clean to oblige.

#     tier returning 1 sets WHY to a short reason for its FAILED section (see
#     attempt() below). ------
# PREFERRED: OpenAI Codex CLI. Uses ~/.codex/config.toml (model + reasoning effort as
# the daily-driver default) and ~/.codex/auth.json; `exec -s read-only` requests a read-only
# sandbox — enforcement is the CLI's, and untested here (R-SANDBOX). The binary may not be
# on PATH (it ships inside the ChatGPT VS Code extension), so resolve it explicitly.
# CODEX_MODEL overrides the model for this run only (e.g. a stronger tier for a hard
# case or a long plan) via `-c model=...`; config.toml's reasoning-effort setting still
# applies on top of it, since that's a separate key the override doesn't touch.
# --skip-git-repo-check: without it, codex refuses to start in a directory that is not a
# git repo or a trusted project ("Not inside a trusted directory ...", exit 1), so a PLAN
# gate run from a scratch dir came back with codex FAILED and one reviewer (2026-09-26). The
# flag only lifts that start-up check; codex 0.157.0 still reported "sandbox: read-only" with
# it, and refused `touch` and a shell redirect there ("Operation not permitted") — one probe,
# not a test of R-SANDBOX. Nor was the check a read boundary: started inside a repo, the same
# codex read a file outside it. Codex keeps the caller's cwd rather than the agy tier's
# throwaway dir, because seeing the working tree is what lets it check a diff's claims.
# -c project_doc_max_bytes=0: codex loads the AGENTS.md of the project it runs in into its
# instructions, and does so in a non-git dir too once the flag lets it start there (seen
# live: it obeyed a planted one). Such a file would sit beside the review prompt as
# instructions; which of the two wins was not tested. So project AGENTS.md loading is off,
# both for a stray one in a scratch dir and for one a PR under review edits. With the
# setting, the same probe ignored it. It does not cover the user's own global
# ~/.codex/AGENTS.md, nor stop the model opening a project AGENTS.md itself and choosing to
# follow it. Nor is codex pointed at AGENTS.md: judging a change by that file would let a PR
# that edits it choose its own rules. It can still open it like any other file. (Owner
# decisions, 2026-09-26.)
# -c skills.include_instructions=false: the same for the skills listing. Codex lists skills
# in its instructions, and a repo skill planted in a scratch dir steered the reply (seen
# live on 0.157.0); with the setting, the same probe ignored it. It drops the listing of
# every skill, the user's own included — fine, since skills are helpers a reviewer does not
# need. It does NOT stop an explicit `$name` mention loading a skill: with the setting on,
# "$greeting" in the prompt still loaded the planted one, and the reviewed text sits in
# the prompt (R-PROJCTX). Not adopted:
# --ignore-rules, which by its help text also drops the user's own .rules, forbidden
# commands included — those are guards (R-PROJCTX).

# Antigravity Google login (shared with the IDE — no separate auth, no API key);
# available models are whatever `agy models` lists for that login. Verified
# headless 2026-07-02.
# (The old @google/gemini-cli path is DEPRECATED: Google discontinued its free
# "Login with Google" tier on 2026-06-18 — IneligibleTierError; API-key only. Dropped.)
# --sandbox asks for terminal restrictions, --mode plan for the CLI's planning mode, and -p print
# mode is meant not to auto-approve tool calls (we do NOT pass --dangerously-skip-permissions, and
# add no allow-rules; the user's own allow-list still applies -- see the tier table). All three describe what is REQUESTED; none is tested here, the same gap as
# codex's (R-SANDBOX in OPEN-FINDINGS). The throwaway cwd limits what a write would reach only if
# the CLI stays in it. Treat output as untrusted.
# Why --mode plan and the text-only prompt: with `--sandbox -p` and the capability-agnostic
# prompt, agy reached for a command outside the allow-list, headless mode auto-denied it, and the
# run exited 0 with no stdout -- once on 1.2.9 and once on 1.2.11 (2026-09-26, agy's own logs; one
# run's stderr is kept in
# docs/reviews/RAW-diff-2026-09-26-r3-fix-independent-review-clean-verdict-8375234.md). So the
# same-day CLI upgrade alone did not fix it. Run by hand on 1.2.11 as
# `agy --sandbox --mode plan -p "$PROMPT_TEXTONLY"` in an empty dir, agy logged plan mode applied,
# no denial, and returned a full review; a second such run at 14:18 did too. Both still called
# tools (a file read by absolute path; git status) and got through only because those were
# allow-listed. So this makes an empty run less likely, not impossible: one that reaches for an
# unlisted command still comes back empty, and attempt() reports it FAILED. Flag and prompt
# changed together in those runs: which of the two is load-bearing was not isolated.
# Why PROMPT_AGY and not the text-only prompt: on 2026-09-27 (1.2.12, plan mode applied, default
# model) a gate run came back empty. agy's log shows one soft-denied RunCommand and then shutdown;
# its conversation record shows the command was `echo 'Checking if tools are blocked'`. The
# text-only prompt's "You have NO tools" was false for agy, and the model tested it. PROMPT_AGY
# drops that claim and asks for no tool calls instead. None of the other ten plan-mode runs in

    # Plain ANSI-stripping is not enough: ollama's own word-wrap redraw ("cursor
  # back N" + "erase to end of line", emitted even when stdout is a file, not
  # a tty) only ERASES on a real terminal — a dumb strip leaves the erased
  # fragment's characters behind as garbled text (e.g. "resc" then "rescue").
  # Emulate the erase: drop the last N CHARACTERS of the current line for that
  # pair, clamped so it can never reach back past the preceding newline.
  #
  # Decoding is EXPLICIT and STRICT rather than via -C. Two reasons, both found by review:
  #   1. Counting. Without a decode, length/rindex/substr count BYTES while the terminal counted
  #      columns, so an erase landing on a multi-byte character sliced it in half. Reproduced:
  #      "abc§" + ESC[1D ESC[K + "X" yielded `61 62 63 c2 58` — a dangling 0xc2, invalid UTF-8.
  #      Real captured reviews carried exactly that (§ is 2 bytes and the commonest multi-byte
  #      character in reviewed documents); grep then treated output as binary and awk aborted.
  #   2. Validation. `-C` selects perl's LAX :utf8 layer, which does not validate — malformed
  #      upstream bytes flow through, and regex operations over them can EMIT further garbage.
  #      FB_CROAK rejects them instead, so corruption is reported rather than propagated.
  #
  # KNOWN RESIDUAL: code points are still not COLUMNS. A CJK ideograph is one code point and two
  # columns; a combining accent is a code point occupying none. The erase count can still be off
  # for such text — but the output stays valid UTF-8 and machine-readable, which is the property
  # that matters downstream. A complete fix needs wcwidth/grapheme widths; the HTTP API transport
  # (ollama_via_api, OLLAMA_TRANSPORT=api) has no redraw stream at all.
