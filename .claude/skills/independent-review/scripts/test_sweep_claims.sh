# test_sweep_claims.sh — drives sweep_claims.sh the way an author does before round 1
# (--base on a branch, --file on a plan, --worktree on uncommitted edits) against a
# throwaway repo: a branch adds known text, then main moves on, as it does in real life.
#
# Why it exists: the sweep is only worth running if it sees what a per-line grep cannot.
# A per-line grep missed a phrase wrapped across a line break; an earlier sweep silently
# dropped every sentence ending in ".)" or ".*"; the one after it dropped the start of any
# sentence with a period inside a word ("Nothing in SKILL.md changes." came out as
# "md changes."). Its first review found more ways to lose a claim: a false split at "e.g."
# or at a wrapped "2024.", a fence opened on a list line, an rst "~~~" underline read as a
# fence, a deleted qualifier, and a user's diff settings. Its second found three of those
# fixes incomplete (a wrapped "2024." inside a list item, a qualifier removed beside a new
# line, one file under two spellings) and inline code read as a fence. Its third found a
# qualifier removed beside an edit that kept its words, two ``` lines indented four spaces
# pairing up around prose, GIT_DIFF_OPTS widening hunks, a file under a relative and an
# absolute spelling, and a crash on a closed stderr or a Latin-1 locale. It also found guards
# no check could fail; the NIT close-out pinned three: a fence closer's length, a "1." item
# after a paragraph, and a Markdown "~~~" fence. Each of those is a fixture here, and case H
# proves the wrapped one really is a miss for grep: a guard that cannot fire is worse than none.

The job never retries

The old runner never ran before
2024. It ran daily after that.

All services, e.g.
workers, use the new runner.

- ```sh
  make

Only the owner can approve.

The pin will not move, and the gate won't wait.

    echo "this never runs"

The cache is never cleared.
Logging is on.

the queue is never drained.
