# Counting assignments by recognising shell syntax was an arms race and lost it twice: a
# declaring keyword with options (`declare -x X=`) and then a conditional (`if true; then X=`;
# round 2, Codex) each slipped past a pattern that had just been widened for the previous one.
# The rule is conservative instead of clever: on any line that is not a whole-line comment, ANY
# textual occurrence of the name followed by `=` or `+=` counts, plus `printf -v NAME`, which
# assigns with no `=` at all. It over-counts a mention inside a string, which fails the check
# rather than passing it -- the safe direction for a guard.
#
# The guarantee is exactly that and no more. An earlier version of this comment claimed every
# assigning syntax contains `NAME=`; `printf -v` disproved it (round 3, Codex), and `eval` of a
# string built at runtime, or a `declare -n` alias, would evade any textual rule. The runtime
# backstop is `readonly` on the four prompt variables in independent_review.sh: a later write of
# any shape fails there, whether or not this check sees it.
